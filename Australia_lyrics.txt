[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad

Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, started off right
I can see it in your eyes
I can tell that you're wantin' more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

[Refrain]
Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts (Yeah)
Can't get what we want without knowin' (No)

Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 2]
Oh, nah
Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room

Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late

Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Three nights at the motel under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up
Three nights at the motel under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up

[Verse 1]
Feel like the least of all your problems
You can reach me if you wanna, stay up tonight, stay up at night
I'm green lights in your body language
Seems like you could use a little company from me
But if you got everything, that figured out like you say
Don't waste a minute, don't wait a minute
It's only a matter of time for you-ooh-ooh-ooh to-ooh-ooh-ooh
Tell me now, 'cause I've been up for I've been up for-

[Chorus]
Three nights at the motel under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want (want)
And you can call me names if you call me up (call me up)
Three nights at the motel under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
I can't fix each and all your problems, I'm no good with names & faces
And she sent me naked pictures from her neck down to the waist
I get my feelings involved, she stopped returnin' my calls
Her flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too far gone in all the wrong ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music, watchin' movies
Talkin' to the walls in my room, walkin through the halls in my head
Just tryna make sure it all makes sense, I ain't made of money
Maybe some day you can take it from me?
I'm up too late, thinkin' 'bout you and M.I.A for

[Chorus]
Three nights at the motel under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want (want)
And you can call me names if you call me up (call me up)
Three nights at the motel under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up (Ooh)

Better than birds of a feather, you and me
We change the weather, yeah
I'm feelin' heat in December when you're 'round me

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain

I'm a sucker for you
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly

Pull up 20 inch blades like I'm Lil’ Troy
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy
Shawty mixing up the vodka with the LaCroix, yeah
G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen
All the housewives pullin’ up (Up, up)
I got a lot of toys, 720S bumpin' Fall Out Boy
You was talkin' shit in the beginning (Mm-mm)
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin' (More forgivin')
I know it piss you off to see me winnin' (See me winnin')
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin’ (I be grinnin’), yeah

[Chorus]
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (On me)
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me (Know me)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)

[Verse 2]
Everywhere I go (Hey)
Catch me on the block like I'm Mutombo (Wow)
750 Lambo in the Utah snow (Skrrt)
Trunk in the front like that shit Dumbo, yeah
Cut the roof off like a nip-tuck
Pull up to the house with some big butts
Turn the kitchen counter to a strip-club (Yeah, wow)
Me and Dre came for the...
When I got guap, all of y'all just appeared (Wow)
Before I dropped Stoney, none of y'all really cared (Cared)
Now they always say, "Congratulations," to the kid (Kid)
And this is not a 40, but I'm pourin' out this shit (Yeah)
Used to have a lot, but I got more now (Yup)
Made another hit 'cause I got bored now (Yup)
Always goin' for it, never punt fourth down
Last call, Hail Mary, Prescott touchdown, ayy

[Chorus]
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (On me)
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army (Hey)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely

[Outro]
Got 'em sayin', "Wow"
Ayy, ayy, wow
Sayin', "Wow"

Wow
[Verse 1]
"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say (Aww)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha)

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Verse 2]
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
(Yay)

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Bridge]
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay

Billie

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
[Verse 1]
I'm here outside when you’re ready (When you're ready for me)
Bring out the shots and confetti (All night long)
I'll take you home if you let me, yeah (Oh yeah)
Just promise you won’t forget me, no

[Chorus]
'Cause the days get brighter when you're here
So I gotta keep you near
Goin' crazy and I just can't get you outta my head
Love is in the atmosphere, you can feel it in the air
Gettin' hazy and I just can't get you outta my head

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah

Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Just can't get you outta my head

[Verse 2]
You locked the door and it’s raining (Just let it rain down)
But baby, I’m not complaining, no
We hit the road and we're racin’ yeah
You make me super impatient (Oh)
Can you feel the tension? You've got my attention
I know we're just friends, but I'd rather be together instead, yeah

[Chorus]
’Cause the days get brighter when you're here
So I gotta keep you near (Oh-ah)
Goin' crazy and I just can't get you outta my head (Yeah)
Love is in the atmosphere, you can feel it in the air (Oh)
Gettin' hazy and I just can't get you outta my head

Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Just can't get you outta my head
[Verse 1]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Verse 2]
I think I see your face in every place that I go
I try to hide it, but I know that it's gonna show
Every single night, I find it harder to sleep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Outro]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
'Cause I need you here with me
[Verse 1]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
Two times clean again, I'm actin' low
A pound of weed and a bag of blow

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Verse 2]
I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to bleed
I'd let go, but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how, but I need to now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
(We could be) We could be more than just part-time lovers
(Part-time lovers, yeah)
(More than, more than lovers)
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Outro]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got a juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)
[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa

[Verse 1: Lauv]
Party, trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me is falling in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it, taking a shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think that they make anything that strong, so I hold on
I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers
And when they leave, I go back to our song, I hold on
I, I, oh I
Hurts like heaven, lost in the sound
Buzz cut season like you're still around
Can't unmiss you and I need you now
Yeah, I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv & Troye Sivan]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
I'm so tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love songs (Someone take me home)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home ('Cause I can't be alone)
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs ('Cause I'm so tired)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
[Verse 1]
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Verse 2]
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Bridge]
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
[Verse 1]
Can't count up the times you've blown my line
And that's been on my mind a lot lately
I wanna leave the extra all behind, mmm
And I know that you wanna be my baby, mmm yeah

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Verse 2]
Oh, we both care about it
But arguing with me just isn't worth it
No, no, no
Don't go reachin' in your bag, your bag, yeah
I didn't text you back 'cause I was workin'
Ah, yeah

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent

Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent

[Bridge]
Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love
You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love
Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love
(Gave you all my time and all my love)
You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin' (Vibin')

When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
When you're looking at my photos
Getting hot, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Now, now, now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more

And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

[Chorus]
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind

Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm here looking fine, babe
And I got eyes looking my way
And everybody's on my vibe, babe

I should have listened to them back then
And now you're tryna hit me up again
Now, now, now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more

And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

[Intro: Khalid]
Uh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Khalid]
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Verse 2: Halsey]
17, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned 23
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

[Chorus: Halsey & Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Bridge: Halsey & Khalid]
Run away now, run away now
Run away now
Run away now, run away now
Run away now

[Outro: Halsey & Khalid]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set

Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are
(Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are)

[Verse 2]
You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around
(You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around)
You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?
(You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?)
'Cause I am
I got so high the other night, I swear to God, felt my feet lift the ground
(I got so high the other night, I swear to God I felt my feet lift the ground)

[Intro: Jennie, Lisa]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA!
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Jennie]
천사 같은 "hi" 끝엔 악마 같은 "bye"
매번 미칠듯한 high 뒤엔 뱉어야 하는 price
이건 답이 없는 test
매번 속더라도 yes
딱한 감정의 노예
얼어 죽을 사랑해, eh

[Verse 2: Lisa]
Here I come kickin' the door, uh
가장 독한 걸로 줘, uh
뻔하디 뻔한 그 love, love
더 내놔봐 give me some more
알아서 매달려 벼랑 끝에
한마디면 또 like 헤벌레 해
그 따뜻한 떨림이 새빨간 설렘이
마치 heaven 같겠지만
You might not get in it

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo & Rosé]
Look at me, look at you
누가 더 아플까
You smart 누가 you are
두 눈에 피눈물 흐르게 된다면
So sorry 누가 you are
나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어
애써 두 눈을 가린 채
사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어

[Chorus: All, Lisa, Jennie]
Let's kill this love!
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Let's kill this love!
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

[Verse 3: Jennie, Lisa]
Feelin' like a sinner
It's so fire with him I go boo, hoo
He said "you look crazy"
Thank you, baby
I owe it all to you
Got me all messed up
His love is my favorite
But you plus me
Sadly can be dangerous

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé & Jisoo]
Lucky me, lucky you
결국엔 거짓말 we lie
So what? So what?
만약에 내가 널 지우게
된다면 so sorry
I'm not sorry
나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어
애써 눈물을 감춘 채, eh
사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어

[Chorus: All, Lisa, Jennie]
Let's kill this love!
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Let's kill this love!
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

[Bridge: Rosé]
We all commit to love
That makes you cry, oh oh
We're all making love
That kills you inside, yeah

[Outro: All]
We must kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Before it kills you too
Kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Gotta kill, let's kill this love!
[Verse 1]
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal
Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape

[Chorus]
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Bridge]
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around

[Chorus]
For now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

But now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Outro]
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the whispers all across the room?
You feel her eyes all over you like cheap perfume
You're beautiful, but misunderstood
So why you tryna be just like the neighborhood?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see ya, I know what you're feelin'
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret
I'm a little crazy underneath this
Underneath this

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Verse 2]
Oh so, dress up fancy like Sid and Nancy (Yeah)
Walkin' Killer Queen, gotta keep 'em guessin'
So baby come pass me a lighter
We're gonna leave 'em on fire
We're the sinners and the blessings

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see ya, I know what you're feelin'
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret
I'm a little crazy underneath this
Underneath this, ooh

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Bridge]
(Ah-ah-ah)
You're king and you're queen
You're strong then you're weak
You're bound but so free
(Ah-ah-ah)
So come and join me
And call me Harley
And we'll make 'em scream

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)
[Verse 1]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

[Pre-Chorus]
Said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

[Bridge]
You don't have to say just what you did (What you did)
I already know (I know)
I had to go and find out from them (Oh-woah)
So tell me, how's it feel? (Oh-woah)

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)

So much shit up on my mind, I couldn't think, yeah
All my niggas rock designer like they scream, yeah
Got the AP covered, diamonds with baguettes, yeah
Say my name in your song and it's lit, yeah
Been waiting for a nigga like this, yeah
We got London On Da Track
[Intro]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 1]
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 2]
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
My god is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now

[Outro]
Haha!
I cannot do this snowflake
[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Bridge]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Outro]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
[Verse 1: Luke Hemmings]
Yeah
Found cigarettes in your Fendi coat
Even though you don't even smoke
Always changin' your access codes
Yeah, I can tell you no one knew

[Pre-Chorus: Luke Hemmings]
Yeah, you've been actin' so conspicuous
You flip it on me, say I think too much
You're movin' different when we makin' love
Baby, tell me, tell me

[Chorus: Luke Hemmings & Ashton Irwin]
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know the truth (Whoa)

Well, keep switchin' your alibi
Or stutterin' when you reply
You can't even look me in the eye
Oh, I can tell, I know you're lyin'

[Pre-Chorus: Calum Hood]
'Cause you've been actin' so conspicuous
You flip it on me, say I think too much
We're movin' different while we're makin' love
So, baby, tell me, tell me

[Chorus: Luke Hemmings & Ashton Irwin]
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know the truth (Whoa)
Who do you love, do you love now?

[Chorus: Luke Hemmings & Ashton Irwin]

Who do you, who do you love, love
Now, now, who do you, who do you love now?
Now, now, who do you, who do you, you
[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Hoo, huh, uh, huhh-ow
Huh, huhh-huhhh

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now
[Verse 1: Drax Project]
Woke up late
Somewhere far away from home
Pockets empty, wallet gone
The sun is streaming all on down on my face
Layin' down on someone's bed
A girl that I had hardly met
My head is spinnin' like I've been out days
Now you're waking up to
Lying next to me in your room
Not quite used to someone so new
Did you catch my name? Yeah
Wonder how long I slept in
I don't know where the hell I've been
But I know that's all right

[Chorus: Drax Project]
Last night, we met at 1
Drank 'til 2, danced 'til 4
Walked you home, awake 'til dawn
Slept 'til noon and now I want more

[Verse 2: Drax Project]
I got that taste, oh
It's in my mouth, it's like I had too much last night
It just felt so right
Because of you, now
I could go or I could stay
'cause I got nothing planned today
And I know that's all right

[Chorus: Drax Project & Hailee Steinfeld]
Last night, we met at 1
Drank 'til 2, danced 'til 4
Walked you home, awake 'til dawn
Slept 'til noon and now I want more

[Bridge: Drax Project]
Why's it so, so easy with the lights down?
Why's it so, so easy when the night's ours?
Why's it so, so easy with the lights down?
Why's it so, so easy? Yeah, so, so easy? Ooh

[Verse 3: Hailee Steinfeld]
Woke up late
Somewhere far away from home
Pockets empty, wallet gone
The sun is streaming all on down on my face
Yeah, last night was fun, let's do it again
We both know we're more than friends
And I know that's alright

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld & Drax Project]
Last night, we met at 1
Drank 'til 2, danced 'til 4
Walked you home, awake 'til dawn
Slept 'til noon and now I want more (More)
Last night, we met at 1
Drank 'til 2, danced 'til 4
Walked you home, awake 'til dawn
Slept 'til noon and now I want more

[Bridge: Drax Project & Hailee Steinfeld]
Why's it so, so easy with the lights down?
Why's it so, so easy when the night's ours?
Why's it so, so easy with the lights down?
Why's it so, so easy? Yeah, so, so easy?

[Outro: Drax Project & Hailee Steinfeld]
Last night, we met at 1
Drank 'til 2, danced 'til 4
Walked you home, awake 'til dawn
Slept 'til noon, and now I want more
[Verse 1]
Can I take you back
To the day we met?
When I stuttered all my words
And I know that made you laugh
And the way you flicked your hair
And I saw the smile you had
Yeah, I know, there's somethin', there's somethin'
Oh, there's somethin' 'bout you
You been gone a while
I’m like where you been?
Just split with another man
Isn't that like number ten?
You said you feelin' alone
And now you need a friend
And oh, there's somethin', there's somethin', oh

[Pre-Chorus]
There's somethin' 'bout you
You You
There's somethin' 'bout you (You)
There's somethin' 'bout
There's somethin' 'bout you (You)

[Chorus]
If you got a moment to spare I've got something to say
(I'm waitin', I'm waitin')
I'm usually impatient but girl, I'd be happy to wait
(I'm waitin', I'm waitin')
I'm losing sleep over dreamin' of you
'Cause if it ain't me, then who?
If you feel the same (I'm waitin')
Hope you feel the same (I'm waitin')
If you feel the same (If you feel the same)
Hope you feel the same

[Verse 2]
I walk away
She slams the door
I should have let you know
I should have told you more
I put my heart on my sleeve
But don't know where it's gone
There's somethin' missin', there's somethin'
Oh, there's somethin' 'bout you
She say she been thinkin'
I say thinkin' about?
But in my mind I kinda
Already figured it out
You say you feelin' somethin'
I said I feel it too
It's that there's somethin', there's somethin', oh

[Pre-Chorus]
There's somethin' 'bout you
You
There's somethin' 'bout you (You)
There's somethin' 'bout
There's somethin' 'bout you (You)

[Chorus]
If you got a moment to spare I've got something to say
(I'm waitin', I'm waitin')
I'm usually impatient but girl, I'd be happy to wait
(I'm waitin', I'm waitin')
I'm losing sleep over dreamin' of you
'Cause if it ain't me, then who?
If you feel the same (I'm waitin')
Hope you feel the same (I'm waitin')
If you feel the same (If you feel the same)

[Bridge]
Waiting for you (I'm waitin')
Always patient for you (I'm waitin')
Yes I am (I'm waitin')
Hope you feel the same
Waiting for you always patient for you (I'm waitin', I'm waitin')
Yes I am (I'm waitin')

[Chorus]
If you got a moment to spare I got something to say
(I'm waitin', I'm waitin', I'm waitin')
I'm usually impatient but girl, I'd be happy to wait
(I'm waitin', I'm waitin', I'm waitin')
I'm losing sleep over dreamin' of you
(I'm waitin', I'm waitin', I'm waitin')
'Cause if it ain't me, then who?
If you feel the same (I'm waitin', I'm waitin')
Hope you feel the same (I'm waitin', I'm waitin')
If you feel the same (If you feel the same)

[Outro]
I’m happy to wait for you girl
Yes, I am oh, oh, oh
[Intro: Ariana Grande]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Victoria Monét]
I've been on a roll, where you been?
Real protective with my soul, where you been?
Is your GPS even on, where you been?
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

[Chorus: Victoria Monét]
Bad vibes, get off of me
Outta here with that fuckery
Treat my goals like property
Collect them like Monopoly
I probably won't come if there's not a fee
And if they try come stoppin' me
I swerve both ways, dichotomy

[Post-Chorus: Victoria Monét & Ariana Grande]
I like women and men (Yeah)
Work so fuckin' much, need a twinny, twin, twin
How you hit the club and you barely got in?
Then we hit the bank, making them investments for the win, oh

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Said, I been on a roll, where you been? (Where you been?)
Real protective with my soul, where you been? (Where you been?)
Is your GPS even on, where you been? (Where you been?)
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Bad vibes, get off of me
Outta here with that fuckery
Treat my goals like property
Collect them like Monopoly
I probably won't come if there's not a fee
And if they try come stoppin' me
I show them my discography (Yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I like women and men (Yeah)
Work so fuckin' much, need a twinny, twin, twin (Hey)
You'd be straight for life if I gave you my PIN (Yeah)
Even though we gave up that 90% for the win, go

[Verse 3: Victoria Monét & Ariana Grande]
I've been on a roll, where you been? (Where you been?)
Real protective with my soul, where you been? (Where you been?)
Is your GPS even on, where you been? (Where you been?)
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, hell no
I don't even care where you been (Oh, yeah)
Hell no (Oh, yeah)
Said I don't even care

[Verse 4: Victoria Monét, Ariana Grande & Both]
Remember when we made a fuckin' album off that Clicquot? (Ooh)
I never track my vocals, so shout out to Eric Vetro (I love Eric Vetro, man)
This been buildin' up, I guess this friendship like Home Depot (Ooh)
I'm so thankful working with my best friend, she the cheat code
She the cheat code (Yeah)

[Outro: Victoria Monét & Ariana Grande]
Where you at? Where you been? (Oh yeah)
Where you been? Where you at, ho? Hey (Where you been?)
Where you at? Where you been, ho? Hey (Mmm, yeah)
I don't care where you been, ho (Been)
Where you been, Cletus?
Yeah, who? (What?) Clevis?
Who the fuck is Cletus?
It's from, um
Cletus? Girl
Nutty Fropessor
We have to wrap, five, six, seven, eight
Yeah
[Intro: Pressure]
I'm sick of us not doin' this right
That's why I think I'm cuttin' you from my life, no more
I'm sick of us not doin' this right
That's why I think I'm cuttin' you from my life, no more

[Verse 1: Pressure]
Wasted energy, spent in a place where every
Hour awake I need an escape to centre me
And I don't mean to make a rush for the door
But times a currency, I'm currently poor
I'll be leavin' here soon, I don't mean to be rude but
This scene ain't for me like your mum seein' your nudes
I've got places I'd rather be and wantin' to see
Stoppin' to breathe is so hard around these oxygen thieves
I ain't waitin' around for all my days to amount
To less than average, shed the baggage that is weighin' me down
You can take my pride and money and leverage that
But you takin' my time is somethin' I'll never get back
And you bet that I'ma jet, do a runner, got a lot of regrets
Won't let you be another, so I'ma
Exit casually, do a stealth
Before I'm the next casualty of myself

[Chorus: Ecca Vandal]
Everybody say hi
Look who's finally arrived
I'm not lookin' for a good time
I'm just lookin' for the exit sign
I'm just tryna get by
Been here one too many times
I'm not standin' in a bathroom line
I'm just lookin' for the exit sign

[Verse 2: Illy]
I am like, "Peace", start fresh like you born-again
Jesus wept, ha, I don't mean it
But don't mind it if it cause offence, we make moves not amends
Feels like you'll never leave, and the chorus went (Ba ba ba ba ba)
Don't care who goes against
Not you not him, not two, not ten, mm-mm
Callin' your bluff, don't call me your friend
You in it for your fifteen minutes, it's quarter past then, goddamn
I'd take a mate's house over this place
Any day out of the calendar dates now
I mean, I ain't even waitin' to bounce
You won't even hear the door hit me on the way out, nah
You ever notice that's how this go?
Ain't it funny how the ones who can flex just don't?
Well, I mean, maybe a little, but you know
They put on a show, we are the show, everybody say

[Chorus: Ecca Vandal]
Everybody say hi
Look who's finally arrived
I'm not lookin' for a good time
I'm just lookin' for the exit sign
I'm just tryna get by
Been here one too many times
I'm not standin' in a bathroom line
I'm just lookin' for the exit sign

[Verse 3: Suffa]
I am like
"Nope" I ain't even tryna check in my
Coat, I'm only tryna check in with my
Folks, and my friends they all know that I won't
Stick around for the blah, blah, blah
Conversation here is shallow as a kid's pool
And it's full of people who say 'literally'
When something is not literal
Are you simple, or are you kiddin' with me?
Go hit the floor, man, I'm sure you want to
I'll hit the door, hit the horn and watch Norm McDonald
Man, it's weird to me that when you're in a band you can get
Appearance fees like you were kicked off The Bachelorette
But I don't give a fuck about the money
And I don't give a fuck about the party
Man, anyone that know me know the only thing
I give a fuck about in this phoney world is Ari

[Pre-Chorus: Pressure & Illy (Suffa)]
If I lose my way (And Poppy)
I know this all amounts to nothin' (So you know)
I've got a million ways for wastin' excess time (I'ma, I'ma get out this stupid club)
But I've got moves to make
And I ain't that self-destructive
I need to bail out towards the exit sign

[Chorus (Extended): Ecca Vandal]
Everybody say hi
Look who's finally arrived
I'm not lookin' for a good time
I'm just lookin' for the exit sign
I'm just tryna get by
Been here one too many times
I'm not standin' in a bathroom line
I'm just lookin' for the exit sign
Everybody say hi
Look who's finally arrived
I'm not lookin' for a good time
I'm just lookin' for the exit sign
I'm just tryna get by
Been here one too many times
I'm not standin' in a bathroom line
I'm just lookin' for the exit sign
[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Khalid]
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (Found)
But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish & Khalid]
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

[Chorus: Billie Eilish with Khalid]
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

[Verse 2: Khalid with Billie Eilish]
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish & Khalid]
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

[Chorus: Billie Eilish with Khalid]
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

[Outro: Khalid, Billie Eilish, Khalid & Billie Eilish]
Woah, yeah
Yeah, ah
Woah, woah
Hello, welcome home
[Intro]
You good, T-Minus?

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Verse 2]
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Outro]
Money in your palm don't make you real
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
Money in your palm don't make you real
[Verse 1]
I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

[Chorus]
And my friend said
"I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright"

[Verse 2]
So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

[Chorus]
And my friend said
"I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go"

[Bridge]
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

[Chorus]
"I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go"

[Outro]
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
[Verse 1]
It's been seven minutes now since I've lost my way
It doesn't seem that long but my whole world has changed
It's in all the little things, when you smile, now it stings
It's been seven minutes since I've lost the girl of my dreams
It's been half an hour now since I dropped you home
And I'm driving past the places we both know
Past the bar where we first kissed and that movie that we missed
'Cause we were hanging out in the parking lot
Now I sink a little deeper, think a little clearer
Looking at myself through these newfound eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too late to turn around?
I'm already halfway out of town
Now I know how I let you down
Oh, I finally figured it out

[Chorus]
I forgot to love you, love you, love you
I forgot to love you, love you, love you

[Verse 2]
Radio's playing songs for me and you
"Chasing Cars" reminds me of nights in your room
Drinking wine under your window, back when life was so damn simple
How the hell did I end up losing you? Mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too late to turn around?
I'm already halfway out of town
Now I know how I let you down
Oh, I finally figured it out

[Chorus]
I forgot to love you, love you, love you
I forgot to love you, love you, love you
I forgot to love you, love you, love you
I forgot to love you, love you

[Bridge]
If I came back now would you still be there?
If I come around would you even care?
If I came back now would you still be there?
If I come around would you even care?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too late to turn around?
I'm already halfway out of town
Now I know how I let you down
Oh, I finally figured it out

[Chorus]
I forgot to love you, love you, love you
I forgot to love you, love you, love you
I forgot to love you, love you, love you
I forgot to love you, love you, love you
[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 1]
She'll make you curse, but she a blessing
She'll rip your shirt within a second
You'll be coming back, back for seconds
With your plate, you just can't help it

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying, "No, no"
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 2]
See, someone said, "Don't drink her potions
She'll kiss your neck with no emotion
When she's mean, you know you love it
She tastes so sweet, don't sugarcoat it"

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying, "No (No, no, no), no (No)"
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Bridge]
You're just like me, you're out your mind
I know it's strange, we're both the crazy kind
You're tellin' me that I'm insane
Boy, don't pretend that you don't love the pain

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Luke]
Remember the words you told me
"Love me 'til the day I die"
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own damn game

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Luke]
Lately our conversations
End like it's the last goodbye
Then one of us gets too drunk
And calls about a hundred times
So, who you been calling baby?
Nobody could take my place
When you’re looking at those strangers
Hope to God you see my face

[Chorus: Luke & All]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Bridge: Luke]
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
You're running around and I'm running away
Running away from you, mmm, from you

[Chorus: All]
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Outro: All]
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
Youngblood
Say you want me
Say you want me out of your life
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight
[Intro]
No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There’s a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn

[Verse 1]
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin’ to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Interlude]
I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life

[Verse 2]
Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever ’cause I don’t self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it (Teh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you’re the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Bridge]
Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my— asking about my motto

[Interlude]
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right?

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Outro]
Did you like it? Did you like that?
Um, which part?
[Intro]
Get to roll no...
Ayy, I'm in the studio, bro
Oh, nah, yeah, call me, ball me
Yeah, I'll... bet
Yeah, I'm at the studio, hold up though

[Verse 1]
I ain't get to roll no weed, I ain't get to roll no Swishers
I was locked up on Christmas, ain't get to see my niggas
Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time

[Chorus]
I wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind (I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind

[Verse 2]
Yellow tape around his body, it's a fucking homicide
His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him it's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind
(I got murder on my mind)

[Verse 3]
Bite like tarantula, bitch, I'm an animal
Melly's a savage, no he not no amateur
Bad bitch named Angela, fucked her on camera
Bitch I'm a murderer (Yeah, yeah)
I might just kill the boy, don't wanna kill the boy
Bake him up, say he want beef, we gon' grill the boy
(Grill the boy, we gonna grill the boy)
I'm bleeding so good, I might dip his ass in it and spill the boy
Haha, murder on my mind, whoa, whoa
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind, huh

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind
(Murder on my mind)

[Outro]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Young Nigga World, bitch
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Verse 2]
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)

[Bridge]
You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown (You should see me, see me)
Your silence is my favorite sound (You should see me, see me)
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one
[Verse 1]
There's somethin' in the way you roll your eyes
Takes me back to a better time
When I saw everything is good
But now you're the only thing that's good
Tryna stand up on my own two feet
This conversation ain't coming easily
And darlin', I know it's getting late
So what do you say we leave this place?

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

[Verse 2]
There's somethin' in the way I wanna cry
That makes me think we'll make it out alive
So come on and show me how we're good
I think that we could do some good, mhm

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
'Cause I can't be alone with all that's on my mind
Say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong, there is so much wrong
There is so much wrong goin' on outside
[Part I]

[Intro: Drake]
Astro, yeah
Sun is down, freezin' cold
That's how we already know, winter's here
My dawg would probably do it for a Louis belt
That's just all he know, he don't know nothin' else
I tried to show 'em, yeah
I tried to show 'em, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Goin' on you with the pick and roll
Young La Flame, he in sicko mode

[Part II]

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Woo, made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot
(Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

[Bridge: Big Hawk & Swae Lee]
Some-Some-Some-Someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Pl-Pl-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (Someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Pl-Pl-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak

[Verse 2: Travis Scott & Uncle Luke]
Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don’t follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, "Hop in, you comin' too"
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, "Where we goin'?" I said, "The moon"
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

[Bridge: Travis Scott, Swae Lee & Big Hawk]
Someone said
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue
Someone said
Pl-Playin' for keeps
Someone said, motherfucker—someone said
Don't play us for weak

[Part III]

[Intro: Travis Scott, Drake & Lil Juice]
Yeah!
Astro, yeah, yeah
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!)
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Drake & Travis Scott]
She's in love with who I am
Back in high school, I used to bus it to the dance (Yeah)
Now I hit the FBO with duffels in my hands
I did half a Xan, 13 hours 'til I land
Had me out like a light, ayy, yeah
Like a light, ayy, yeah

[Verse 3: Drake & Travis Scott]
Like a light, ayy, slept through the flight, ayy
Knocked for the night, ayy
767, man, this shit got double bedroom, man
I still got scores to settle, man
I crept down the block (Down the block)
Made a right (Yeah, right)
Cut the lights (Yeah, what?), paid the price (Yeah)
Niggas think it's sweet (Nah, never), it's on sight (Yeah, what?)
Nothin' nice (Yeah), baguettes in my ice (Aw, man)
Jesus Christ (Yeah), checks over stripes (Yeah)
That's what I like (Yeah), that's what we like (Yeah)
Lost my respect, you not a threat
When I shoot my shot, that shit wetty like I'm Sheck (Bitch)
See the shots that I took (Ayy), wet like I'm Book (Ayy)
Wet like I'm Lizzie
I be spinnin' Valley, circle blocks 'til I'm dizzy (Yeah, what?)
Like where is he? (Yeah, what?)
No one seen him (Yeah, yeah)
I'm tryna clean 'em (Yeah)

[Chorus: Drake & Travis Scott]
She's in love with who I am
Back in high school, I used to bus it to the dance
Now I hit the FBO with duffels in my hands (Woo)
I did half a Xan, 13 hours 'til I land
Had me out like a light (Like a light)
Like a light (Like a light)
Like a light (Like a light)
Like a light

[Verse 4: Travis Scott]
Yeah, passed the dawgs a celly
Sendin' texts, ain't sendin' kites, yeah
He said, "Keep that on lock"
I say, "You know this shit, it's stife," yeah
It's absolute, yeah (Yeah), I'm back, reboot (It's lit)
LaFerrari to Jamba Juice, yeah (Skrrt, skrrt)
We back on the road, they jumpin' off, no parachute, yeah
Shawty in the back
She said she workin' on her glutes, yeah (Oh my God)
Ain't by the book, yeah, this how it look, yeah
'Bout a check, yeah (Check), just check the foots, yeah
Pass this to my daughter, I'ma show her what it took (Yeah)
Baby mama cover Forbes, got these other bitches shook
Yeah
[Verse 1]
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share

[Chorus]
I'm in their second hand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Interlude]
Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god
(And it's like, wait, like, when?)

[Verse 2]
Wakin' up at sundown (Ooh)
They're late to every party (Ooh)
Nobody's ever sorry (Ooh)
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down (Come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (Hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (Learning)
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance

[Chorus]
I'm in their second hand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Bridge]
Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake

[Outro]
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doin' nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Come down
Hurting
Learning
[Verse 1]
Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Verse 2]
Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Bridge]
'Cause I care, I care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be
Than right here around you
I care, care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care about you
Nowhere like I do
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
Don't care about you
Nowhere like I
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
