[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad
[Verse 1: Sabrina Carpenter]
I'm sorry but, don't wanna talk
I need a moment 'fore I go
It's nothin' personal
I draw the blinds, they don't need to see me cry
'Cause even if they understand, they don't understand

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
So then, when I'm finished
I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
I'm takin' my misery, make it my bitch
Can't be everyone's favourite girl

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way

[Verse 2: Farruko]
(Ya, ya)
(Farru, yeah, guaya)
Lo siento mucho (Farru), pero me voy (Eh)
Porque a tu lado me di cuenta que nada soy (Eh-ey)
Y me cansé de luchar y de guerrear en vano
De estar en la línea de fuego y de meter la mano
Acepto mis errore', también soy humano
Y tú no ve' que lo hago porque te amo (Pum-pum-pum-pum)

[Pre-Chorus: Farruko]
Pero ya (Ya) no tengo más na' que hacer aquí (Aquí)
Me voy, llegó la hora 'e partir (Partir)
De mi propio camino, seguir lejos de ti

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter & Farruko]
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise (Is on the rise, na-na)
The fire burning in my eyes (The fire burning in my eyes, no)
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way, uh

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Sabrina Carpenter & Farruko]
I'm on my way
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody on my way

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
We go together
Better than birds of a feather, you and me
We change the weather, yeah
I'm feelin' heat in December when you're 'round me

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I'm a sucker for you
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly

I don't remember when you're 'round me (Oh, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]

[Verse 1]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
Two times clean again, I'm actin' low
A pound of weed and a bag of blow

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Verse 2]
I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to bleed
I'd let go, but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how, but I need to now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
(We could be) We could be more than just part-time lovers
(Part-time lovers, yeah)
(More than, more than lovers)
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Outro]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got a juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)

[Intro: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Oh, oh-oh

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 2: Lil Nas X]
Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Verse 3: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Outro: Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
[Verse 1]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Verse 2]
I think I see your face in every place that I go
I try to hide it, but I know that it's gonna show
Every single night, I find it harder to sleep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Outro]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
'Cause I need you here with me

[Verse 1]
"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say (Aww)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha)

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Verse 2]
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
(Yay)

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Bridge]
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Hoo, huh, uh, huhh-ow
Huh, huhh-huhhh

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now
[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight
[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I

Bring out the shots and confetti (All night long)
I'll take you home if you let me, yeah (Oh yeah)
Just promise you won’t forget me, no

[Chorus]
'Cause the days get brighter when you're here
So I gotta keep you near
Goin' crazy and I just can't get you outta my head
Love is in the atmosphere, you can feel it in the air
Gettin' hazy and I just can't get you outta my head

You locked the door and it’s raining (Just let it rain down)
But baby, I’m not complaining, no
We hit the road and we're racin’ yeah
You make me super impatient (Oh)
Can you feel the tension? You've got my attention
I know we're just friends, but I'd rather be together instead, yeah

[Chorus]
’Cause the days get brighter when you're here
So I gotta keep you near (Oh-ah)
Goin' crazy and I just can't get you outta my head (Yeah)
Love is in the atmosphere, you can feel it in the air (Oh)
Gettin' hazy and I just can't get you outta my head

[Intro: Sam Smith]
Hmm, mhm

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
I don't wanna be alone tonight (Alone tonight)
It's pretty clear that I'm not over you (Over you, over you)
I'm still thinking 'bout the things you do (Things you do)
So I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight
Can you light the fire? (Light the fire, light the fire)
I need somebody who can take control (Take control)

Always changin' your access codes
Yeah, I can tell you no one knew

Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know the truth (Whoa)
Who do you love, do you love now?
I know it's someone new
You ain't gotta make it easy, where you been sleepin'?
This shit is keepin' me up at night, just admit it
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know, I wanna know who

[Post-Chorus: All]
Now, now, who do you, who do you love, love (Yeah)
Now, now, who do you, who do you love now? (Oh)

[Chorus: Luke Hemmings & Ashton Irwin]
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know the truth (Whoa)
Who do you love, do you love now?

Who do you love, do you love now?

[Chorus: Luke Hemmings & Ashton Irwin]
You ain't gotta make it easy, where you been sleepin'?

Now, now, who do you, who do you, you
[Intro: Mehki Raine]
Billie

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
[Verse 1]
This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Verse 2]
Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Bridge]
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa

[Verse 1: Lauv]
Party, trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me is falling in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it, taking a shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think that they make anything that strong, so I hold on
I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers
And when they leave, I go back to our song, I hold on
I, I, oh I
Hurts like heaven, lost in the sound
Buzz cut season like you're still around
Can't unmiss you and I need you now
Yeah, I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv & Troye Sivan]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
I'm so tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love songs (Someone take me home)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home ('Cause I can't be alone)
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs ('Cause I'm so tired)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
[Verse 1]
When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
When you're looking at my photos
Getting hot, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Now, now, now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

[Chorus]
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm here looking fine, babe
And I got eyes looking my way
And everybody's on my vibe, babe
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
My friends said you were a bad man
I should have listened to them back then
And now you're tryna hit me up again
Now, now, now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

[Chorus]
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up

[Bridge]
Don't call me up
So don't call me up
Don't call me up

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

[Chorus]
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up
[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, started off right
I can see it in your eyes
I can tell that you're wantin' more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

[Refrain]
Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts (Yeah)
Can't get what we want without knowin' (No)
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 2]
Oh, nah
Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room
I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock

[Refrain]
Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Outro]
Figure out where we're goin'
[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin'—

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Said thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fucking—

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)

[Verse 1]
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

[Chorus 1]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

[Verse 2]
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

[Chorus 2]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, that's okay baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

[Bridge]
Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, that's okay baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go

[Outro]
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home
[Intro: Ariana Grande]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Victoria Monét]
I've been on a roll, where you been?
Real protective with my soul, where you been?
Is your GPS even on, where you been?
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

[Chorus: Victoria Monét]
Bad vibes, get off of me
Outta here with that fuckery
Treat my goals like property
Collect them like Monopoly
I probably won't come if there's not a fee
And if they try come stoppin' me
I swerve both ways, dichotomy

[Post-Chorus: Victoria Monét & Ariana Grande]
I like women and men (Yeah)
Work so fuckin' much, need a twinny, twin, twin
How you hit the club and you barely got in?
Then we hit the bank, making them investments for the win, oh

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Said, I been on a roll, where you been? (Where you been?)
Real protective with my soul, where you been? (Where you been?)
Is your GPS even on, where you been? (Where you been?)
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Bad vibes, get off of me
Outta here with that fuckery
Treat my goals like property
Collect them like Monopoly
I probably won't come if there's not a fee
And if they try come stoppin' me
I show them my discography (Yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I like women and men (Yeah)
Work so fuckin' much, need a twinny, twin, twin (Hey)
You'd be straight for life if I gave you my PIN (Yeah)
Even though we gave up that 90% for the win, go

[Verse 3: Victoria Monét & Ariana Grande]
I've been on a roll, where you been? (Where you been?)
Real protective with my soul, where you been? (Where you been?)
Is your GPS even on, where you been? (Where you been?)
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, hell no
I don't even care where you been (Oh, yeah)
Hell no (Oh, yeah)
Said I don't even care

[Verse 4: Victoria Monét, Ariana Grande & Both]
Remember when we made a fuckin' album off that Clicquot? (Ooh)
I never track my vocals, so shout out to Eric Vetro (I love Eric Vetro, man)
This been buildin' up, I guess this friendship like Home Depot (Ooh)
I'm so thankful working with my best friend, she the cheat code
She the cheat code (Yeah)

[Outro: Victoria Monét & Ariana Grande]
Where you at? Where you been? (Oh yeah)
Where you been? Where you at, ho? Hey (Where you been?)
Where you at? Where you been, ho? Hey (Mmm, yeah)
I don't care where you been, ho (Been)
Where you been, Cletus?
Yeah, who? (What?) Clevis?
Who the fuck is Cletus?
It's from, um
Cletus? Girl
Nutty Fropessor
We have to wrap, five, six, seven, eight
Yeah
[Intro]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 1]
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 2]
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
My god is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now

[Outro]
Haha!
I cannot do this snowflake
[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the whispers all across the room?
You feel her eyes all over you like cheap perfume
You're beautiful, but misunderstood
So why you tryna be just like the neighborhood?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see ya, I know what you're feelin'
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret
I'm a little crazy underneath this
Underneath this

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Verse 2]
Oh so, dress up fancy like Sid and Nancy (Yeah)
Walkin' Killer Queen, gotta keep 'em guessin'
So baby come pass me a lighter
We're gonna leave 'em on fire
We're the sinners and the blessings

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see ya, I know what you're feelin'
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret
I'm a little crazy underneath this
Underneath this, ooh

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Bridge]
(Ah-ah-ah)
You're king and you're queen
You're strong then you're weak
You're bound but so free
(Ah-ah-ah)
So come and join me
And call me Harley
And we'll make 'em scream

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)
[Verse 1]
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

[Chorus]
That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Chorus]
So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are
[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Hands on your body, I'm grabbin' your ass
Enjoyin' the moment 'cause life move too fast
I'm lookin' forward, ignorin' the past
These are the times that we'll laugh lookin' back
I'm gettin' lucky like coins in the well
Goodbye to my haters, I'm wishin' you well
This is my year, man, if you couldn't tell

[Pre-Chorus]
This is our life and we livin' it well
Late nights in the city, causin' hell
Burn this bitch into the ground, oh well
If all we got tonight, let's do this right
Let's do this right

[Chorus]
Let's go to (Paradise)
This shit feel like Friday nights
This shit make me feel alive
I feel like we in paradise, paradise (Paradise)
Don't know if it's the drink I poured
But I swear I've never loved you more
When you right here, I come alive
One more hit and we can fly
This shit feel like (Paradise)

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' it, my head's where the ceilin' is (Oh yeah)
This energy turns nights into memories (Oh yeah)
Count up the bands, you've been workin' all summer
Ex didn't know what he had, what a bummer
Insecure people turn to insecure lovers
Well, my drink is almost out and I'm about to pour another

[Bridge]
Just let it out
The night has just begun, we on a level now
If I get too fucked up, promise you'll hold me down
Yeah, this that shit you can't deny
This that shit you feel inside

[Pre-Chorus]
This our life, our time, we livin' well
Late nights in the city, causin' hell
Burn this bitch into the ground, oh well
If all we got tonight, let's do this right
Let's do this right

[Chorus]
Let's go to (Paradise)
This shit feel like Friday nights (Ooh, it do)
This shit make me feel alive (Baby)
I feel like we in paradise, paradise (Paradise, oh yeah)
Don't know if it's the drink I poured (Poured)
But I swear I've never loved you more (Loved you more)
When you right here, I come alive
One more hit and we can fly
This shit feel like (Paradise)
[Verse 1]
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Verse 2]
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Bridge]
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
[Verse 1]
You got me some type of way (Hmm)
Ain't used to feelin' this way (Mmm-mmm)
I do not know what to say (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one fuckin' look at your face (Hmm)
Now I wanna know how you taste (Mmm-mmm)
Usually don't give it away (Yeah, yeah)
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (Mornin')
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours

Why can't we just play for keeps? (Mmm-mmm)
Practically on my knees (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
You know what you're doin' to me
You're singin' my songs in the streets, yeah, yeah
Actin' all innocent, please
When I know you out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you realize she's right there (Yeah)
And you're at home like, "Damn, she can't compare"

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (In the mornin')

[Bridge]
You could say I'm hatin' if you want to
But I only hate on her 'cause I want you
Say I'm trippin' if you feel like
But you without me ain't right (Ain't right)
You could call me crazy 'cause I want you
And I never even ever fuckin' met you
Say I'm trippin' and it ain't right
But you without me ain't nice (Ain't nice, yeah)

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (Hit in the mornin', yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Intro]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)

[Verse 1]
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

[Chorus]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 2]
Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

[Chorus]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I got the—
[Verse 1]
That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe, I wanna catch on fire
It’s buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn’t find

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Verse 2]
Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo hoo hooooooooo

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down and the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Way yeah

[Outro]
When you look at me and the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way

[Outro]
Oooh, oooh, hmmmm
Oooh, oooh, hmmmm
[Verse 1]
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

[Pre-Chrous]
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

[Chorus]
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

[Verse 2]
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

[Chorus 2]
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

[Outro]
‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you
[Verse 1]
Said she tired of little money, need a big boy
Pull up 20 inch blades like I'm Lil’ Troy
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy
Shawty mixing up the vodka with the LaCroix, yeah
G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen
All the housewives pullin’ up (Up, up)
I got a lot of toys, 720S bumpin' Fall Out Boy
You was talkin' shit in the beginning (Mm-mm)
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin' (More forgivin')
I know it piss you off to see me winnin' (See me winnin')
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin’ (I be grinnin’), yeah

[Chorus]
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (On me)
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me (Know me)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)

[Verse 2]
Everywhere I go (Hey)
Catch me on the block like I'm Mutombo (Wow)
750 Lambo in the Utah snow (Skrrt)
Trunk in the front like that shit Dumbo, yeah
Cut the roof off like a nip-tuck
Pull up to the house with some big butts
Turn the kitchen counter to a strip-club (Yeah, wow)
Me and Dre came for the...
When I got guap, all of y'all just appeared (Wow)
Before I dropped Stoney, none of y'all really cared (Cared)
Now they always say, "Congratulations," to the kid (Kid)
And this is not a 40, but I'm pourin' out this shit (Yeah)
Used to have a lot, but I got more now (Yup)
Made another hit 'cause I got bored now (Yup)
Always goin' for it, never punt fourth down
Last call, Hail Mary, Prescott touchdown, ayy

[Chorus]
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (On me)
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army (Hey)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me (Yeah, yeah)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow"

[Outro]
Got 'em sayin', "Wow"
Ayy, ayy, wow
Sayin', "Wow"
Wow
Wow
[Verse 1]
Can't count up the times you've blown my line
And that's been on my mind a lot lately
I wanna leave the extra all behind, mmm
And I know that you wanna be my baby, mmm yeah

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Verse 2]
Oh, we both care about it
But arguing with me just isn't worth it
No, no, no
Don't go reachin' in your bag, your bag, yeah
I didn't text you back 'cause I was workin'
Ah, yeah

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Bridge]
Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love
You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love
Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love
(Gave you all my time and all my love)
You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin' (Vibin')
Gotta put my phone on silent (On silent)
So my, my, my, my bad (My bad)
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin' (Blowin' me up)
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Outro]
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my
My bad, my bad
Alright
