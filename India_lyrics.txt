[Verse 1: Sabrina Carpenter]
I'm sorry but, don't wanna talk
I need a moment 'fore I go
It's nothin' personal
I draw the blinds, they don't need to see me cry
'Cause even if they understand, they don't understand

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
So then, when I'm finished
I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
I'm takin' my misery, make it my bitch
Can't be everyone's favourite girl

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way

[Verse 2: Farruko]
(Ya, ya)
(Farru, yeah, guaya)
Lo siento mucho (Farru), pero me voy (Eh)
Porque a tu lado me di cuenta que nada soy (Eh-ey)
Y me cansé de luchar y de guerrear en vano
De estar en la línea de fuego y de meter la mano
Acepto mis errore', también soy humano
Y tú no ve' que lo hago porque te amo (Pum-pum-pum-pum)

[Pre-Chorus: Farruko]
Pero ya (Ya) no tengo más na' que hacer aquí (Aquí)
Me voy, llegó la hora 'e partir (Partir)
De mi propio camino, seguir lejos de ti

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter & Farruko]
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise (Is on the rise, na-na)
The fire burning in my eyes (The fire burning in my eyes, no)
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way, uh

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Sabrina Carpenter & Farruko]
I'm on my way
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody on my way

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
[Verse 1: V]
내가 날 눈치챘던 순간
떠나야만 했어
난 찾아내야 했어
All day all night

[Verse 2: Jimin]
사막과 바다들을 건너
넓고 넓은 세계를
헤매어 다녔어
Baby I

[Refrain: Jungkook]
I could make it better
I could hold you tighter
그 먼 길 위에서
Oh you’re the light

[Verse 4: V]
초대받지 못한
환영받지 못한
나를 알아줬던 단 한 사람

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
끝도 보이지 않던 영원의 밤
내게 아침을 선물한 건 너야
이제 그 손 내가 잡아도 될까
Oh oh
I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Verse 5: J-Hope]
이 세상 속에 영웅이 된 나
나를 찾는 큰 환호와
내 손, 트로피와 금빛 마이크
All day, everywhere
But 모든 게 너에게 닿기 위함인 걸
내 여정의 답인 걸
널 찾기 위해 노래해
Baby to you

[Verse 6: RM]
전보다 조금 더 커진 키에
좀 더 단단해진 목소리에
모든 건 네게 돌아가기 위해
이제 너라는 지도를 활짝 펼칠게
My rehab
날 봐 왜 못 알아봐
남들의 아우성 따위 나 듣고 싶지 않아
너의 향기는 여전히 나를 꿰뚫어 무너뜨려
되돌아가자 그때로

[Refrain: Jin]
Baby I know
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
그 모든 길은 널
향한 거야

[Verse 7: Jimin]
다 소용없었어
너 아닌 다른 건
그때처럼 날 어루만져줘

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
끝도 보이지 않던 영원의 밤
내게 아침을 선물한 건 너야
이제 그 손 내가 잡아도 될까
Oh oh
I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Bridge: Suga]
여전히 아름다운 너
그날의 그때처럼 말없이 그냥 날 안아줘
지옥에서 내가 살아 남은 건
날 위했던 게 아닌 되려 너를 위한 거란 걸
안다면 주저 말고 please save my life
너 없이 헤쳐왔던 사막 위는 목말라
그러니 어서 빨리 날 잡아줘
너 없는 바다는 결국 사막과 같을 거란 걸 알아

[Refrain: Jimin, Jungkook]
All right
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
Oh I can make it right

[Outro: V, Jimin]
다 소용없었어
너 아닌 다른 건
Oh I can make it right

[Jungkook, Jimin, V]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right
[Intro: RM]
I'm exhausted man
Oh, guess what?
I just want to go home

[Verse 1: Jimin, RM]
미칠듯한 설레임에
인사조차 못했어 (yeah, right)
Yeah I’m going out baby
온 세상이 내 집

[Verse 2: V, RM]
Crazy for myself (yeah)
저 문을 열면 뭐든 다 될 것처럼 (right)
마치 무슨 본때를 보여줄 것처럼 (uh huh)
집을 나섰지
(이 모든 상상이 다 신기루로 끝나지 않길)

[Verse 3: RM]
Oh yeah I did it, me shine with flashin' lights
Got lotta friends, 고즈넉한 내 공간
그래 기억해 뭐든 다 할 수 있을 것만 같던 때
I saw the ocean yeah 이 문을 열기도 전에
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, Jin]
뭔가 채울수록 더 비어가
함께일수록 더 혼자인 것 같아
반쯤 감긴 눈, 잠 못 드는 밤
니가 있는 곳

[Chorus: V, Jin, RM]
아마 그곳이 Mi Casa
With you I'mma feel rich
바로 그곳이 Mi Casa
미리 켜둬 너의 switch
Yeah

[Post-Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, V, RM]
말을 안 해도 편안할 거야
너만 있다면 다 내 집이 될 거야
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that
Home

[Refrain: Jimin, Jungkook]
Your love your love your love (I miss that)
Your love your love your love (I want that)
Your touch your touch your touch (I need that)
La la la la la la la la I love it

[Verse 4: J-Hope]
불 꺼진 현관에 내 발이 이상해
눈 감고 이불 안에 있어도 이상해
둥 붕 뜬 기분 빙 도는 두 눈
이 멋진 공간에 나 완전 초라해

[Verse 5: Suga]
완전 초라해
세상은 우리가 세상을 다 가진 줄 아는군
꿈에 그리던 Big house, big cars, big rings
내가 원한 건 모든 걸 가져도
뭔가 허전한 지금 모든 걸 이룬 자가 느낀 낯선 기분
But 지금 떠나도 돌아올 곳이 있기에 나서는 문

[Bridge: Jin]
갈림길에서 자꾸 생각나
볼품없던 날 알아줬던 너
니 생각에 웃을 수 있었어
니가 있는 곳

[Chorus: Jimin, V]
아마 그곳이 Mi Casa
With you I’mma feel rich
바로 그곳이 Mi Casa
미리 켜둬 너의 switch
Yeah

[Post-Chorus: Jimin, V]
말을 안 해도 편안할 거야
너만 있다면 다 내 집이 될 거야
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that
Home

[Verse 6: Jimin, Jungkook, Jin]
그 언젠가
초인종이 세 번 울리면
문을 열어주겠니
미처 못한 인사를 전할 수 있게
그땐 말할게

[Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
오랜만이야 Mi Casa
With you I just feel rich
다녀왔어 Hi Mi Casa
켜뒀구나 너의 switch
Yeah

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin]
말을 안 해도 편안하잖아
니가 있어서 나의 집이 된 거야
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that
Home

[Refrain: Jungkook, V, Jimin]
Your love your love your love (I miss that)
Your love your love your love (I want that)
Your touch your touch your touch (I need that)
La la la la la la la la I love it

투명한 크리스탈 잔 속 찰랑이는 예술
예술도 술이지 뭐, 마시면 취해 fool
You dunno you dunno
You dunno what to do with
내가 보여줄게 난 전혀 다른 걸 추진
아이비와 거친 나무로 된 mic
절대 단 한 숨에
나오는 소리 따윈 없다

무대에 오를 때 들리는 환호성
Can't you see my stacked
Broken thyrsus
이제 난 다시 태어나네 비로소

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
When the night comes
Mumble mumble mumble

Tumble tumble tumble

[Verse 1: Jin]
또 져버린 것 같아
넌 화가 나 보여
아른대는 Game over over over

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
만약 게임이라면
또 load하면 되겠지만
I guess I gotta deal with this, deal with this
Real world

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
차라리 게임이면 좋겠지
너무 아프니까
I need to heal my medic
But I’m another star
완벽하지 못했던 나를 탓해
Brake in my head, brake in my step, always
그저 잘하고 싶었고
웃게 해주고 싶었는데.. damn

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
Please give me a remedy
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
이제 어떻게 해야 해
날 살려줘 다시 기회를 줘
Please give me

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
A remedy, a melody
오직 내게만 남겨질 그 memory
이쯤에서 그만하면
꺼버리면 모든 게 다 편해질까

[Verse 4: Jin]
괜찮지만 괜찮지 않아
익숙하다고 혼잣말했지만
늘 처음인 것처럼 아파

[Verse 5: J-Hope]
부족한 gamer, 맞아 날 control 못하지
계속 아파 ‘Cause 시행착오와 오만 가지
내 노래 가사, 몸짓 하나
말 한마디 다 내 미시감에 무서워지고
또 늘 도망가려 해
But 잡네, 그래도 네가
내 그림자는 커져가도 내 삶과 넌 equal sign
So 내 remedy는 your remedy

[Chorus: Jin, Jungkook]
Please give me a remedy
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
이제 어떻게 해야 해
날 살려줘 다시 기회를 줘
Please give me a

[Bridge: Jin, Jungkook]
(Remedy)
또 다시 뛰고, 또 넘어지고
(Honestly)
수없이 반복된대도
난 또 뛸 거라고

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
So give me a remedy
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
이제 어떻게 해야 해
날 살려줘 다시 기회를 줘

[Outro: Jungkook, Jin, J-Hope]
Please give me a remedy
(성공인가. 돌아왔어)
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
(집중해서 꼭 네게 닿고 말겠어. 떨어지고, 넘어지고)
이제 어떻게 해야 해
(익숙한 아픔이 똑같이 날 덮쳐)
날 살려줘
(이번에도 쉽지 않아)
다시 기회를 줘
(관둘 거냐고? No, no never)
I won’t give up
[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad
[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got a juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)
[Verse 1]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
Two times clean again, I'm actin' low
A pound of weed and a bag of blow

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Verse 2]
I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to bleed
I'd let go, but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how, but I need to now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
(We could be) We could be more than just part-time lovers
(Part-time lovers, yeah)
(More than, more than lovers)
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Outro]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest

Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Outro: Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Intro: Jennie, Lisa]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA!
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Jennie]
천사 같은 "hi" 끝엔 악마 같은 "bye"
매번 미칠듯한 high 뒤엔 뱉어야 하는 price
이건 답이 없는 test
매번 속더라도 yes
딱한 감정의 노예
얼어 죽을 사랑해, eh

[Verse 2: Lisa]
Here I come kickin' the door, uh
가장 독한 걸로 줘, uh
뻔하디 뻔한 그 love, love
더 내놔봐 give me some more
알아서 매달려 벼랑 끝에
한마디면 또 like 헤벌레 해
그 따뜻한 떨림이 새빨간 설렘이
마치 heaven 같겠지만
You might not get in it

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo & Rosé]
Look at me, look at you
누가 더 아플까
You smart 누가 you are
두 눈에 피눈물 흐르게 된다면
So sorry 누가 you are
나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어
애써 두 눈을 가린 채
사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어

[Chorus: All, Lisa, Jennie]

I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there

Yeah, I, I, oh I, yeah

When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
When you're looking at my photos
Getting hot, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Now, now, now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

[Chorus]
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind

You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up

'Cause I'm here looking fine, babe
And I got eyes looking my way
And everybody's on my vibe, babe

I should have listened to them back then
And now you're tryna hit me up again
Now, now, now, now

I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more

[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Bridge]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Outro]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly

Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
[Verse 1]
To be young and in love in New York City
To not know who I am but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me
To be drunk and in love in New York City
Midnight into morning coffee, burning through the hours talking
Damn

[Chorus]
I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
I don't know what it is but I got that feeling
Waking up in this bed next to you swear the room, yeah, it got no ceiling
If we lay, let the day just pass us by
I might get to too much talking, I might have to tell you something
Damn

[Chorus]
I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you

[Bridge]
Stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay here with me
Stay awhile, stay awhile, oh
Stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay here with me
Lay here with me, ooh

[Chorus]
I like me better when I'm with you (yes I do, yes I do, babe)
I like me better when I'm with you (oooh noo)
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you

[Outro]
(I like me, I like me)
(Look who you made me, made me, oh noo)
Better when
I like me better when I'm with you
[Intro: Khalid]
Uh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Khalid]
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Verse 2: Halsey]
17, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned 23
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

[Chorus: Halsey & Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Bridge: Halsey & Khalid]
Run away now, run away now
Run away now
Run away now, run away now
Run away now

[Outro: Halsey & Khalid]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
[Verse 1]
You got me some type of way (Hmm)
Ain't used to feelin' this way (Mmm-mmm)
I do not know what to say (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one fuckin' look at your face (Hmm)
Now I wanna know how you taste (Mmm-mmm)
Usually don't give it away (Yeah, yeah)
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (Mornin')
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (Care)
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored

[Verse 2]
This shit always happen to me (Yeah)
Why can't we just play for keeps? (Mmm-mmm)
Practically on my knees (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
You know what you're doin' to me
You're singin' my songs in the streets, yeah, yeah
Actin' all innocent, please
When I know you out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you realize she's right there (Yeah)
And you're at home like, "Damn, she can't compare"

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (In the mornin')
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (I don't care, yee)
Break up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored

[Post-Chorus]
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend
With your girlfriend
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend

[Bridge]
You could say I'm hatin' if you want to
But I only hate on her 'cause I want you
Say I'm trippin' if you feel like
But you without me ain't right (Ain't right)
You could call me crazy 'cause I want you
And I never even ever fuckin' met you
Say I'm trippin' and it ain't right
But you without me ain't nice (Ain't nice, yeah)

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (Hit in the mornin', yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (Care, yeah)
Break up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored

[Post-Chorus]
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, baby, girlfriend
With your girlfriend
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend
With your girlfriend
