[Verse 1]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
Two times clean again, I'm actin' low
A pound of weed and a bag of blow

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Verse 2]
I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to bleed
I'd let go, but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how, but I need to now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
(We could be) We could be more than just part-time lovers
(Part-time lovers, yeah)
(More than, more than lovers)
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Outro]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest

[Verse 1: DAOKO]
I can still remember the shore we saw that day...
The words we wrote in the sand... the sight of you as you turned away
The waves ebb and flow across my feet, carrying something away
In the evening calm, twilight alone passes me by

[Chorus 1: DAOKO & Yonezu Kenshi]
We watched fireworks blooming in a flash of light
Surely this summer is far from over
And has unraveled our uncertain hearts, tying them together
I wanted this night to go on forever

[Verse 2: Yonezu Kenshi]
I wonder how many times I'll be able to watch the same fireworks as you
What can I do for the sake of your smiling face?
Feeling hurt, feeling happy... repetitive waves and regularities
Uneasiness and the sound of the evening's last train
Again and again, I’ll put it into words, and call to you
Seeking the pause between waves, I’ll try once again...
So that you'll never have to feel sad again

[Chorus 2: DAOKO & Yonezu Kenshi]
A light that seemed it might disappear if we let out a gasp
Surely remained within our hearts
A warm future we felt when we reached out our hands
Was secretly watching us

[Refrain: DAOKO & Yonezu Kenshi]
Fireworks, in flash of light
Bloomed in the night
They bloomed in the night
And disappeared silently
Don't let go (Don't go away)
Just a little longer
Let us stay like this
Just a little longer

[Verse 1 (partial): DAOKO]
I can still remember the shore we saw that day...
The words we wrote in the sand... the sight of you as you turned away

[Chorus 1: DAOKO & Yonezu Kenshi]
We watched fireworks blooming in a flash of light
Surely this summer is far from over
And has unraveled our uncertain hearts, tying them together
I wanted this night to go on forever
[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Bridge]
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
[Intro: RM]
I'm exhausted man
Oh, guess what?
I just want to go home

[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad
[Verse 1]
I know they don’t like me that much
Guess that I don’t dress how they want
I just wanna be myself
I can’t be someone else
Try to color inside their lines
Try to live a life by design
I just wanna be myself
I can’t be someone else, someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
They yell, they preach, I’ve heard it all before
"Be this, be that", I’ve heard it before, heard it before

[Chorus]
Big boys don’t cry
Shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in
Good girls don’t fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in

[Post-Chorus]
Stand out, fit in
Stand out, fit in

[Verse 2]
Lately, it’s been too much all day
Words shot like a cannon at me
I just wanna be myself
I can’t be someone else, someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
They yell, they preach, I’ve heard it all before
"Be this, be that", I’ve heard it before, heard it before

[Chorus]
Big boys don’t cry
Shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in
Good girls don’t fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in

[Post-Chorus]
Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in

[Bridge]
I am who I am, no matter what
Never changing, no matter what, no matter what

[Chorus]
Big boys don’t cry
Shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in
Good girls don’t fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in
Big boys don’t cry
Shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in
Good girls don’t fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in

[Post-Chorus]
Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in

[Verse 1]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Verse 2]
I think I see your face in every place that I go
I try to hide it, but I know that it's gonna show
Every single night, I find it harder to sleep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Outro]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
'Cause I need you here with me

I won't forget you
As I go along the crooked road
Crossing the yellow sand
With the newborn sun and my dreams

I can never go back
To the day where we rolled around tickling each other...
I know a future even more boisterous than I imagined
Is waiting for me

With only the sound of "I love you"
I felt I could become strong...
Hold me tight enough
To crush this meager happiness

With my dirty hand
I wrote down thoughts that seemed to overflow --
I said I wanted you
To throw away that letter right away

I'm just a little sleepy;
I pry my eyes open with cold water...
Now everything passes by
As if being urged on, as if being shot past

With only the sound of "I love you"
I felt I could become strong...
I want to see you again here
Someday

No matter how far I walk
I can't get there...
My cheeks were wet by the snow in my heart
I pretended to be a demon and ripped up this song
And changed it to flower petals
Dancing in the spring breeze...

I won't forget you
As I go along the crooked road...
I know a future even more boisterous than I imagined
Is waiting for me

With only the sound of "I love you"
I felt I could become strong...
Hold me tight enough
To crush this meagre happiness

Whether honest or sneaky
I felt that I could keep on living...
I want to see you again here
Someday
[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
We go together
Better than birds of a feather, you and me
We change the weather, yeah
I'm feelin' heat in December when you're 'round me

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I'm a sucker for you
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (About you), about you (About you)
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you, yeah

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Don't complicate it (Yeah)
'Cause I know you and you know everything about me
I can't remember (Yeah) all of the nights
I don't remember when you're 'round me (Oh, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I'm a sucker for you
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly

And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you, yeah (Uh)

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
(I'm a sucker for you)
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly

[Verse 1]
Must be something in the water
Feel like I can take the world
Throw the weight up on my shoulders
‘Cause I won’t even feel the burn

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t be afraid to dive
Be afraid that you didn’t try
These moments remind us why
We’re here, we’re so alive

[Chorus]
Let's live like we’re immortal
Live just for tonight
We’ll think about tomorrow, yeah, when the sun comes up
‘Cause by this time tomorrow
We’ll be talking ‘bout tonight
Keep doing what we want, we want, we want
No more wasted nights

[Verse 2]
Records spinning, we don’t notice
Fill this room with memories
Everybody’s chasing something
But we got everything we need

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t be afraid to dive
Be afraid that you didn’t try
These moments remind us why
We’re here, we’re so alive

[Chorus]
Let's live like we’re immortal
Live just for tonight
We’ll think about tomorrow, yeah, when the sun comes up
‘Cause by this time tomorrow
We’ll be talking ‘bout tonight
Keep doing what we want, we want, we want
No more wasted nights

[Bridge]
I don’t wanna wait, I don’t want a wasted night
I don’t wanna wait, I don’t want a wasted night
I don’t wanna wait, I don’t want a wasted night
I don’t wanna wait, I don’t want a wasted night

[Chorus]
Let's live like we’re immortal
Live just for tonight
We’ll think about tomorrow, yeah, when the sun comes up
‘Cause by this time tomorrow
We’ll be talking ‘bout tonight
Keep doing what we want, we want, we want
No more wasted nights

[Outro]
I don’t wanna wait, I don’t want a wasted night
I don’t wanna wait, no more wasted nights
[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got a juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)
[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin'—

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)

I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fucking—

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
