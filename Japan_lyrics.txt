[Intro: Jennie, Lisa]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA!
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Jennie]
천사 같은 "hi" 끝엔 악마 같은 "bye"
매번 미칠듯한 high 뒤엔 뱉어야 하는 price
이건 답이 없는 test
매번 속더라도 yes
딱한 감정의 노예
얼어 죽을 사랑해, eh

[Verse 2: Lisa]
Here I come kickin' the door, uh
가장 독한 걸로 줘, uh
뻔하디 뻔한 그 love, love
더 내놔봐 give me some more
알아서 매달려 벼랑 끝에
한마디면 또 like 헤벌레 해
그 따뜻한 떨림이 새빨간 설렘이
마치 heaven 같겠지만
You might not get in it

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo & Rosé]
Look at me, look at you
누가 더 아플까
You smart 누가 you are
두 눈에 피눈물 흐르게 된다면
So sorry 누가 you are
나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어
애써 두 눈을 가린 채
사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어

[Chorus: All, Lisa, Jennie]
Let's kill this love!
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Let's kill this love!
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

[Verse 3: Jennie, Lisa]
Feelin' like a sinner
It's so fire with him I go boo, hoo
He said "you look crazy"
Thank you, baby
I owe it all to you
Got me all messed up
His love is my favorite
But you plus me
Sadly can be dangerous

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé & Jisoo]
Lucky me, lucky you
결국엔 거짓말 we lie
So what? So what?
만약에 내가 널 지우게
된다면 so sorry
I'm not sorry
나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어
애써 눈물을 감춘 채, eh
사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어

[Chorus: All, Lisa, Jennie]
Let's kill this love!
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Let's kill this love!
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

[Bridge: Rosé]
We all commit to love
That makes you cry, oh oh
We're all making love
That kills you inside, yeah

[Outro: All]
We must kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Before it kills you too
Kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Gotta kill, let's kill this love!
[Verse 1]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
Two times clean again, I'm actin' low
A pound of weed and a bag of blow

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Verse 2]
I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to bleed
I'd let go, but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how, but I need to now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
(We could be) We could be more than just part-time lovers
(Part-time lovers, yeah)
(More than, more than lovers)
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Outro]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
[Verse 1: V]
내가 날 눈치챘던 순간
떠나야만 했어
난 찾아내야 했어
All day all night

[Verse 2: Jimin]
사막과 바다들을 건너
넓고 넓은 세계를
헤매어 다녔어
Baby I

[Refrain: Jungkook]
I could make it better
I could hold you tighter
그 먼 길 위에서
Oh you’re the light

[Verse 4: V]
초대받지 못한
환영받지 못한
나를 알아줬던 단 한 사람

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
끝도 보이지 않던 영원의 밤
내게 아침을 선물한 건 너야
이제 그 손 내가 잡아도 될까
Oh oh
I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Verse 5: J-Hope]
이 세상 속에 영웅이 된 나
나를 찾는 큰 환호와
내 손, 트로피와 금빛 마이크
All day, everywhere
But 모든 게 너에게 닿기 위함인 걸
내 여정의 답인 걸
널 찾기 위해 노래해
Baby to you

[Verse 6: RM]
전보다 조금 더 커진 키에
좀 더 단단해진 목소리에
모든 건 네게 돌아가기 위해
이제 너라는 지도를 활짝 펼칠게
My rehab
날 봐 왜 못 알아봐
남들의 아우성 따위 나 듣고 싶지 않아
너의 향기는 여전히 나를 꿰뚫어 무너뜨려
되돌아가자 그때로

[Refrain: Jin]
Baby I know
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
그 모든 길은 널
향한 거야

[Verse 7: Jimin]
다 소용없었어
너 아닌 다른 건
그때처럼 날 어루만져줘

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
끝도 보이지 않던 영원의 밤
내게 아침을 선물한 건 너야
이제 그 손 내가 잡아도 될까
Oh oh
I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Bridge: Suga]
여전히 아름다운 너
그날의 그때처럼 말없이 그냥 날 안아줘
지옥에서 내가 살아 남은 건
날 위했던 게 아닌 되려 너를 위한 거란 걸
안다면 주저 말고 please save my life
너 없이 헤쳐왔던 사막 위는 목말라
그러니 어서 빨리 날 잡아줘
너 없는 바다는 결국 사막과 같을 거란 걸 알아

[Refrain: Jimin, Jungkook]
All right
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
Oh I can make it right

[Outro: V, Jimin]
다 소용없었어
너 아닌 다른 건
Oh I can make it right

[Jungkook, Jimin, V]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right
[Verse 1: DAOKO]
I can still remember the shore we saw that day...
The words we wrote in the sand... the sight of you as you turned away
The waves ebb and flow across my feet, carrying something away
In the evening calm, twilight alone passes me by

[Chorus 1: DAOKO & Yonezu Kenshi]
We watched fireworks blooming in a flash of light
Surely this summer is far from over
And has unraveled our uncertain hearts, tying them together
I wanted this night to go on forever

[Verse 2: Yonezu Kenshi]
I wonder how many times I'll be able to watch the same fireworks as you
What can I do for the sake of your smiling face?
Feeling hurt, feeling happy... repetitive waves and regularities
Uneasiness and the sound of the evening's last train
Again and again, I’ll put it into words, and call to you
Seeking the pause between waves, I’ll try once again...
So that you'll never have to feel sad again

[Chorus 2: DAOKO & Yonezu Kenshi]
A light that seemed it might disappear if we let out a gasp
Surely remained within our hearts
A warm future we felt when we reached out our hands
Was secretly watching us

[Refrain: DAOKO & Yonezu Kenshi]
Fireworks, in flash of light
Bloomed in the night
They bloomed in the night
And disappeared silently
Don't let go (Don't go away)
Just a little longer
Let us stay like this
Just a little longer

[Verse 1 (partial): DAOKO]
I can still remember the shore we saw that day...
The words we wrote in the sand... the sight of you as you turned away

[Chorus 1: DAOKO & Yonezu Kenshi]
We watched fireworks blooming in a flash of light
Surely this summer is far from over
And has unraveled our uncertain hearts, tying them together
I wanted this night to go on forever
[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Bridge]
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
[Intro: RM]
I'm exhausted man
Oh, guess what?
I just want to go home

[Verse 1: Jimin, RM]
미칠듯한 설레임에
인사조차 못했어 (yeah, right)
Yeah I’m going out baby
온 세상이 내 집

[Verse 2: V, RM]
Crazy for myself (yeah)
저 문을 열면 뭐든 다 될 것처럼 (right)
마치 무슨 본때를 보여줄 것처럼 (uh huh)
집을 나섰지
(이 모든 상상이 다 신기루로 끝나지 않길)

[Verse 3: RM]
Oh yeah I did it, me shine with flashin' lights
Got lotta friends, 고즈넉한 내 공간
그래 기억해 뭐든 다 할 수 있을 것만 같던 때
I saw the ocean yeah 이 문을 열기도 전에
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, Jin]
뭔가 채울수록 더 비어가
함께일수록 더 혼자인 것 같아
반쯤 감긴 눈, 잠 못 드는 밤
니가 있는 곳

[Chorus: V, Jin, RM]
아마 그곳이 Mi Casa
With you I'mma feel rich
바로 그곳이 Mi Casa
미리 켜둬 너의 switch
Yeah

[Post-Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, V, RM]
말을 안 해도 편안할 거야
너만 있다면 다 내 집이 될 거야
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that
Home

[Refrain: Jimin, Jungkook]
Your love your love your love (I miss that)
Your love your love your love (I want that)
Your touch your touch your touch (I need that)
La la la la la la la la I love it

[Verse 4: J-Hope]
불 꺼진 현관에 내 발이 이상해
눈 감고 이불 안에 있어도 이상해
둥 붕 뜬 기분 빙 도는 두 눈
이 멋진 공간에 나 완전 초라해

[Verse 5: Suga]
완전 초라해
세상은 우리가 세상을 다 가진 줄 아는군
꿈에 그리던 Big house, big cars, big rings
내가 원한 건 모든 걸 가져도
뭔가 허전한 지금 모든 걸 이룬 자가 느낀 낯선 기분
But 지금 떠나도 돌아올 곳이 있기에 나서는 문

[Bridge: Jin]
갈림길에서 자꾸 생각나
볼품없던 날 알아줬던 너
니 생각에 웃을 수 있었어
니가 있는 곳

[Chorus: Jimin, V]
아마 그곳이 Mi Casa
With you I’mma feel rich
바로 그곳이 Mi Casa
미리 켜둬 너의 switch
Yeah

[Post-Chorus: Jimin, V]
말을 안 해도 편안할 거야
너만 있다면 다 내 집이 될 거야
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that
Home

[Verse 6: Jimin, Jungkook, Jin]
그 언젠가
초인종이 세 번 울리면
문을 열어주겠니
미처 못한 인사를 전할 수 있게
그땐 말할게

[Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
오랜만이야 Mi Casa
With you I just feel rich
다녀왔어 Hi Mi Casa
켜뒀구나 너의 switch
Yeah

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin]
말을 안 해도 편안하잖아
니가 있어서 나의 집이 된 거야
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that
Home

[Refrain: Jungkook, V, Jimin]
Your love your love your love (I miss that)
Your love your love your love (I want that)
Your touch your touch your touch (I need that)
La la la la la la la la I love it
[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad
[Verse 1]
I know they don’t like me that much
Guess that I don’t dress how they want
I just wanna be myself
I can’t be someone else
Try to color inside their lines
Try to live a life by design
I just wanna be myself
I can’t be someone else, someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
They yell, they preach, I’ve heard it all before
"Be this, be that", I’ve heard it before, heard it before

[Chorus]
Big boys don’t cry
Shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in
Good girls don’t fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in

[Post-Chorus]
Stand out, fit in
Stand out, fit in

[Verse 2]
Lately, it’s been too much all day
Words shot like a cannon at me
I just wanna be myself
I can’t be someone else, someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
They yell, they preach, I’ve heard it all before
"Be this, be that", I’ve heard it before, heard it before

[Chorus]
Big boys don’t cry
Shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in
Good girls don’t fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in

[Post-Chorus]
Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in

[Bridge]
I am who I am, no matter what
Never changing, no matter what, no matter what

[Chorus]
Big boys don’t cry
Shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in
Good girls don’t fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in
Big boys don’t cry
Shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in
Good girls don’t fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in

[Post-Chorus]
Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in
[Verse 1: Jin]
또 져버린 것 같아
넌 화가 나 보여
아른대는 Game over over over

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
만약 게임이라면
또 load하면 되겠지만
I guess I gotta deal with this, deal with this
Real world

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
차라리 게임이면 좋겠지
너무 아프니까
I need to heal my medic
But I’m another star
완벽하지 못했던 나를 탓해
Brake in my head, brake in my step, always
그저 잘하고 싶었고
웃게 해주고 싶었는데.. damn

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
Please give me a remedy
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
이제 어떻게 해야 해
날 살려줘 다시 기회를 줘
Please give me

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
A remedy, a melody
오직 내게만 남겨질 그 memory
이쯤에서 그만하면
꺼버리면 모든 게 다 편해질까

[Verse 4: Jin]
괜찮지만 괜찮지 않아
익숙하다고 혼잣말했지만
늘 처음인 것처럼 아파

[Verse 5: J-Hope]
부족한 gamer, 맞아 날 control 못하지
계속 아파 ‘Cause 시행착오와 오만 가지
내 노래 가사, 몸짓 하나
말 한마디 다 내 미시감에 무서워지고
또 늘 도망가려 해
But 잡네, 그래도 네가
내 그림자는 커져가도 내 삶과 넌 equal sign
So 내 remedy는 your remedy

[Chorus: Jin, Jungkook]
Please give me a remedy
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
이제 어떻게 해야 해
날 살려줘 다시 기회를 줘
Please give me a

[Bridge: Jin, Jungkook]
(Remedy)
또 다시 뛰고, 또 넘어지고
(Honestly)
수없이 반복된대도
난 또 뛸 거라고

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
So give me a remedy
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
이제 어떻게 해야 해
날 살려줘 다시 기회를 줘

[Outro: Jungkook, Jin, J-Hope]
Please give me a remedy
(성공인가. 돌아왔어)
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
(집중해서 꼭 네게 닿고 말겠어. 떨어지고, 넘어지고)
이제 어떻게 해야 해
(익숙한 아픔이 똑같이 날 덮쳐)
날 살려줘
(이번에도 쉽지 않아)
다시 기회를 줘
(관둘 거냐고? No, no never)
I won’t give up

[Verse 1]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Verse 2]
I think I see your face in every place that I go
I try to hide it, but I know that it's gonna show
Every single night, I find it harder to sleep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Outro]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
'Cause I need you here with me

[Intro: Persona - RM 가사]

나는 누구인가 평생 물어온 질문
아마 평생 정답은 찾지 못할 그 질문
나란 놈을 고작 말 몇 개로
답할 수 있었다면
신께서 그 수많은 아름다움을
다 만드시진 않았겠지
How you feel 지금 기분이 어때
사실 난 너무 좋아 근데 조금 불편해
나는 내가 개인지 돼진지
뭔지도 아직 잘 모르겠는데
남들이 와서 진주목걸일 거네
칵 퉤

예전보단 자주 웃어
소원했던 Superhero
이젠 진짜 된 것 같어
근데 갈수록 뭔 말들이 많어
누군 달리라고 누군 멈춰서라 해
얘는 숲을 보라고
걔는 들꽃을 보라 해
내 그림자
나는 망설임이라 쓰고 불렀네
걘 그게 되고 나서
망설인 적이 없었네
무대 아래든 아님 조명 아래든
자꾸 나타나
아지랑이처럼 뜨겁게
자꾸 날 노려보네 Oh shit
야 이 짓을 왜 시작한 건지
벌써 잊었냐
넌 그냥 들어주는 누가 있단 게
막 좋았던 거야
가끔은 그냥 싹 다 헛소리 같아
취하면 나오는 거 알지 치기 같아
나 따위가 무슨 music
나 따위가 무슨 truth
나 따위가 무슨 소명
나 따위가 무슨 muse
내가 아는 나의 흠
어쩜 그게 사실 내 전부
세상은 사실 아무 관심 없어
나의 서툼
이제 질리지도 않는 후회들과
매일 밤 징그럽게 뒹굴고
돌릴 길 없는 시간들을
습관처럼 비틀어도
그때마다 날 또 일으켜 세운 것
최초의 질문
내 이름 석 자
그 가장 앞에 와야 할 But

So I'm askin' once again yeah
Who the hell am I
Tell me all your names baby
Do you wanna die
Oh do you wanna go
Do you wanna fly
Where's your soul
Where's your dream
Do you think you're alive

My name is R
내가 기억하고 사람들이 아는 나
날 토로하기 위해
내가 스스로 만들어낸 나
Yeah 난 날 속여왔을지도
뻥쳐왔을지도
But 부끄럽지 않아
이게 내 영혼의 지도
Dear myself
넌 절대로 너의 온도를 잃지 마
따뜻히도 차갑게도 될 필요 없으니까
가끔은 위선적이어도 위악적이어도
이게 내가 걸어두고 싶은
내 방향의 척도
내가 되고 싶은 나 사람들이 원하는 나
니가 사랑하는 나 또 내가 빚어내는 나
웃고 있는 나 가끔은 울고 있는 나
지금도 매분 매순간 살아 숨쉬는

Persona
Who the hell am I
I just wanna go I just wanna fly
I just wanna give you
All the voices till I die
I just wanna give you
All the shoulders when you cry

Persona
Who the hell am I
I just wanna go I just wanna fly
I just wanna give you
All the voices till I die
I just wanna give you
All the shoulders when you cry
君を忘れない
曲がりくねった道を行く
生まれたての太陽と
夢を渡る黄色い砂

二度と戻れない
くすぐりあって転げた日
きっと想像した以上に
騒がしい未来がぼくを待ってる

(Chorus)
「愛してる」の響きだけで
強くなれる気がしたよ
ささやかな喜びを
つぶれるほど抱きしめて

こぼれそうな想い
汚れた手で書きあげた
あの手紙はすぐにでも
捨てて欲しいと言ったのに
少しだけ眠い
冷たい水でこじあけて
今せかされるように
飛ばされるように通り過ぎてく

「愛してる」の響きだけで
強くなれる気がしたよ
いつかまたこの場所で
君と巡り会いたい

どんなに歩いても
たどり着けない
心の雪で濡れた頬
悪魔のふりして
切り裂いた歌を
春の風に舞う花びらに変えて
Uh--

君を忘れない
曲がりくねった道を行く
きっと想像した以上に
騒がしい未来がぼくを待ってる

「愛してる」の響きだけで
強くなれる気がしたよ
ささやかな喜びを
つぶれるほど抱きしめて
ズルしてもまじめにも
生きてゆける気がしたよ
いつかまたこの場所で
君と巡り会いたい

I won't forget you
As I go along the crooked road
Crossing the yellow sand
With the newborn sun and my dreams

I can never go back
To the day where we rolled around tickling each other...
I know a future even more boisterous than I imagined
Is waiting for me

With only the sound of "I love you"
I felt I could become strong...
Hold me tight enough
To crush this meager happiness

With my dirty hand
I wrote down thoughts that seemed to overflow --
I said I wanted you
To throw away that letter right away

I'm just a little sleepy;
I pry my eyes open with cold water...
Now everything passes by
As if being urged on, as if being shot past

With only the sound of "I love you"
I felt I could become strong...
I want to see you again here
Someday

No matter how far I walk
I can't get there...
My cheeks were wet by the snow in my heart
I pretended to be a demon and ripped up this song
And changed it to flower petals
Dancing in the spring breeze...

I won't forget you
As I go along the crooked road...
I know a future even more boisterous than I imagined
Is waiting for me

With only the sound of "I love you"
I felt I could become strong...
Hold me tight enough
To crush this meagre happiness

Whether honest or sneaky
I felt that I could keep on living...
I want to see you again here
Someday

[Verse 1]
Must be something in the water
Feel like I can take the world
Throw the weight up on my shoulders
‘Cause I won’t even feel the burn

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t be afraid to dive
Be afraid that you didn’t try
These moments remind us why
We’re here, we’re so alive

[Chorus]
Let's live like we’re immortal
Live just for tonight
We’ll think about tomorrow, yeah, when the sun comes up
‘Cause by this time tomorrow
We’ll be talking ‘bout tonight
Keep doing what we want, we want, we want
No more wasted nights

[Verse 2]
Records spinning, we don’t notice
Fill this room with memories
Everybody’s chasing something
But we got everything we need

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t be afraid to dive
Be afraid that you didn’t try
These moments remind us why
We’re here, we’re so alive

[Chorus]
Let's live like we’re immortal
Live just for tonight
We’ll think about tomorrow, yeah, when the sun comes up
‘Cause by this time tomorrow

No more wasted nights

[Outro]
I don’t wanna wait, I don’t want a wasted night
I don’t wanna wait, no more wasted nights
[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got a juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)
[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin'—

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fucking—

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
