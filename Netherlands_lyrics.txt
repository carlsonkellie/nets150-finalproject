[Verse 1]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
Two times clean again, I'm actin' low
A pound of weed and a bag of blow

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Verse 2]
I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to bleed
I'd let go, but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how, but I need to now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
(We could be) We could be more than just part-time lovers
(Part-time lovers, yeah)
(More than, more than lovers)
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Outro]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
[Verse 1]
When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
When you're looking at my photos
Getting hot, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Now, now, now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

[Chorus]
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm here looking fine, babe
And I got eyes looking my way
And everybody's on my vibe, babe
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
My friends said you were a bad man
I should have listened to them back then
And now you're tryna hit me up again
Now, now, now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

[Chorus]
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up

[Bridge]
Don't call me up
So don't call me up
Don't call me up

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

[Chorus]
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up
[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

[Pre-Chorus]
I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

[Verse 2]
How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Ooh, ooh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

[Bridge]
I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this rollercoaster

Loving you is a losing game

All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change

[Verse 1: Rag’n’Bone Man]
I understood loneliness before I knew what it was
I saw the pills on the table for your unrequited love
I would be nothing without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us

[Chorus: Rag’n’Bone Man]
I am the giant (Ooh)

Togetherness, togetherness, togetherness

I am the giant (Ooh)
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see

This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door

I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace

Can we just talk? Can we just talk?

Hello, sweet grief
I know you'll be the death of me
Feel like the morning after ecstasy
I am drowning in an endless sea
Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doing everything I can
To make sure I never love again

[Pre-Chorus: Sophia Somajo]
I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel

If I had a diamond heart, oh, oh
I'd give you all my love if I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart, oh, oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bendin' like a tulip, blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire, breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got

I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter, beautiful and battered
Into the poison, cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got
If

[Verse 2: Sophia Somajo]
Goodbye, so long
I don't know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong?
'Cause every station's playing our song
Goodbye, my love
You are everything my dreams made up
You'll be Prince and I'm the crying dove
If I only were unbreakable

I wish that I did not know (Ooh)
Where all broken lovers go (Ooh)

High, high hopes

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

[Verse 1]
Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything

Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

The stranger crusaders, ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything (High, high hopes)

Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me-eh-eh-eh
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh

Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

She'll make you curse, but she a blessing
She'll rip your shirt within a second
You'll be coming back, back for seconds
With your plate, you just can't help it

You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying, "No, no"
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 2]
See, someone said, "Don't drink her potions
She'll kiss your neck with no emotion
When she's mean, you know you love it
She tastes so sweet, don't sugarcoat it"

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying, "No (No, no, no), no (No)"
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Bridge]
You're just like me, you're out your mind
I know it's strange, we're both the crazy kind
You're tellin' me that I'm insane
Boy, don't pretend that you don't love the pain

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
[Intro: Sam Smith]
Hmm, mhm

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
I don't wanna be alone tonight (Alone tonight)
It's pretty clear that I'm not over you (Over you, over you)
I'm still thinking 'bout the things you do (Things you do)
So I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight
Can you light the fire? (Light the fire, light the fire)
I need somebody who can take control (Take control)
I know exactly what I need to do
'Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
Dancing with a stranger

[Verse 2: Normani]
I wasn't even going out tonight (Out tonight)
But, boy, I need to get you off of my mind (Off of my mind)
I know exactly what I have to do
I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight

[Chorus: Normani, Sam Smith & Both]
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new

Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
I'm dancing, I'm dancing (Ooh)
I'm dancing, I'm dancing (Dancing with a stranger)
I'm dancing, I'm dancing (Dancing with a stranger)
I'm dancing, I'm dancing (Dancing with a stranger)
[Verse]
I remember how it all started
Feeling warm though the summer was over
And our little lives, they felt so big then
We're lonely, reaching stars at night in the big black sky
And you said to me

[Chorus]
If you love me, then say you love me
That you are mine
Hey, come on, darling, stop the hiding
Speak your mind
Woah, I loved you
But you left me speechless, then
Say if you love me, then say you love me
And you are mine

[Verse]
I remember how it all started
Feeling warm though the summer was over
And our little lives, they felt so big then
We're lonely, reaching stars at night in the big black sky
And you said to me

[Chorus]
If you love me, then say you love me
That you are mine
Hey, come on, darling, stop the hiding
Speak your mind
Woah, I loved you
But you left me speechless, then
Say if you love me, then say you love me
And you are mine

[Post-Chorus]
You left me speechless, speechless
You left me speechless
You left me speechless, speechless
You left me speechless, speechless

[Outro]
So if you love me, then say you love me
That you are mine
Hey, come on, darling
Speechless
[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got a juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)
[Intro: Mehki Raine]
Billie

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
[Verse 1]
Eat, sleep and please
Independent on her knees
There’s more to her
Free as a bee
Till the queen will disagree
There’s more to her

[Pre-Chorus 1]
On Sunday she will loudly pray
Please don’t care what other people say
But Mondays always stay the same
She builds so they can break
Oh, they want you to crawl, fuck them all

[Chorus]
You just gotta go skyward, aim higher
When you’ve had enough
You should rise above
And go skyward with high force
They can’t get you down
When you’re off the ground

[Post-Chorus]
So tell them what you wanna say
'Cause they won’t hear you anyway
And go skyward, aim higher
When you’ve had enough
You should rise above

[Verse 2]
Feel that she’s real
Though the fake will seal the deal
Make room for her
Or she’ll leave every meal
Till she’s skinny as a needle
Root for her

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, convincing herself everyday
I don’t care what other people say
Oh, they know she’s lying anyway
She builds so they can break
Still they want her to crawl, fuck em all

[Chorus]
You just gotta go skyward, aim higher
When you’ve had enough
You should rise above
And go skyward with high force
They can’t get you down
When you’re off the ground

[Post-Chorus]
So tell them what you wanna say
Cause they won’t hear you anyway
And go skyward, aim higher
When you’ve had enough
You should rise above

[Bridge]
Skyward, higher
She’s more than a provider
More than you desire
Skyward, higher
Make room for all the failures
Root for all the fighters

[Chorus]
You just gotta go skyward, aim higher
When you’ve had enough
You should rise above
And go skyward with high force
They can’t get you down
When you’re off the ground

[Post-Chorus]
So tell them what you wanna say (So tell them what you wanna say)
'Cause they won’t hear you anyway ('Cause they won't hear you anyway)
And go skyward, aim higher
When you’ve had enough
You should rise above

[Outro]
Skyward
[Verse 1]
I hold your hand and squeeze it softly, 'cause I realize
I love you more now than I ever did before
For the bitter and the sweet and through these weary times
And I’ve never thought of letting you go
I've never ever thought of letting you go

[Chorus]
I'd be lost without you
You’re someone to fight for
Someone to die for
Oh, look at us now
I'd be lost without you
You're someone to care for
Someone to be there for
Oh, look at us now

[Post-Chorus]
We will make it through somehow
We will make it through somehow

[Verse 2]
I know you're scared and there's a million things to worry 'bout
I know you're tired, you're afraid of what you’ll dream
And you can yell at me, be mad at me, just cry it out
I’ve never thought of letting you go
No, I've never thought of letting you go

[Chorus]
I’d be lost without you
You're someone to fight for
Someone to die for
Oh, look at us now
I'd be lost without you
You're someone to care for
Someone to be there for
Oh, look at us now

[Post-Chorus]
We will make it through somehow
We will make it through somehow

[Bridge]
Just let me hold your hand through night and day
And I will kiss your every fear away
Now listen closely to these words I say
I’ve never thought of letting you go
No, I've never thought of letting you go

[Chorus]
I'd be lost without you
You're someone to fight for
Someone to die for
Oh, look at us now
Lost without you
You're someone to care for
Someone to be there for
Oh, look at us now
I'd be lost without you
You're someone to fight for
Someone to die for
Look at us now

[Post-Chorus]
We will make it through somehow
We will make it through somehow
We will make it through somehow
[Verse 1]
That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe, I wanna catch on fire
It’s buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn’t find

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Verse 2]
Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo hoo hooooooooo

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down and the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Way yeah

[Outro]
When you look at me and the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way

[Outro]
Oooh, oooh, hmmmm
Oooh, oooh, hmmmm
[Verse 1: BONN]
Summer nights all align
As we drown in the moonlight
We collide in plain sight
Yeah, I know we'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus: BONN]
And we come alive, we run the night with strangers
'Cause in the end, we're all familiar faces
We're young and wild, enjoy the ride, we made it
We made it

[Chorus: BONN]
I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
Say you'll never leave
Because I love the feeling, I love the feeling
Find myself awake at night
See you through my lucid eyes
Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

[Post-Chorus: BONN]
I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

[Verse 2: BONN]
Wide awake, no time to waste
Make a mark on my timeline
We're safe and sound, we come around
We are dancing, the sun down

[Pre-Chorus: BONN]
And we come alive, we run the night with strangers
'Cause in the end, we're all familiar faces
We're young and wild, enjoy the ride, we made it
We made it

[Chorus: BONN]
I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
Say you'll never leave
Because I love the feeling, I love the feeling
Find myself awake at night
See you through my lucid eyes
Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

[Post-Chorus: BONN]
Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

[Outro: BONN]
Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
[Verse 1]
Just one more thing before I go
Before I let you take the throne
You go right and I stay left
And if you ever get too close
You'll know my name before I go

[Bridge]
They love me then they love you now (Mmm)
But don't forget there's one more round (Mmm)
Oh, the pain, I know it well
But it hasn't kept me down
You think you got me figured out

[Chorus]
You thought you had me
You thought that I was done but
I'm stronger up against the ropes
I am a fighter before this fight is over
You'll know my name before I go (Ooo)
You'll know my name before I go

[Verse 2]
Just one more thing before I go (go)
Before the final curtains close (oh)
There's no telling what comes next
These tired hands will show
You'll know my name before I go
Just one more thing before the end (oh)
No, time has never been a friend (oh)
To the dreamer, to the lover
To the one who needs to win
Watch out cause here it comes
I say when I am done

[Chorus]
You thought you had me
You thought that I was done but
I'm stronger up against the ropes
I am a fighter before this fight is over
You'll know my name before I go (Ooo)
You'll know my name before I go (Ooo)
You'll know my name

[Bridge]
Just one more thing before I go yeah

[Chorus]
You thought you had me
You thought that I was done but
I'm stronger up against the ropes
I am a fighter before this fight is over
You'll know my name before I go (Ooo)
You'll know my name before I go (Ooo)
