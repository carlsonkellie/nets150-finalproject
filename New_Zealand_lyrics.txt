[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad

Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, started off right
I can see it in your eyes
I can tell that you're wantin' more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

[Refrain]
Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts (Yeah)
Can't get what we want without knowin' (No)

Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 2]
Oh, nah
Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room
I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock

Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Verse 1]
"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say (Aww)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha)

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Verse 2]
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
(Yay)

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Bridge]
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay

Billie

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
[Verse 1]
Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Verse 2]
Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Bridge]
'Cause I care, I care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be
Than right here around you
I care, care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be

[Chorus]
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care about you
Nowhere like I do
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
Don't care about you
Nowhere like I
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
[Chorus]
Three nights at the motel under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up
Three nights at the motel under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up

[Verse 1]
Feel like the least of all your problems
You can reach me if you wanna, stay up tonight, stay up at night
I'm green lights in your body language
Seems like you could use a little company from me
But if you got everything, that figured out like you say
Don't waste a minute, don't wait a minute
It's only a matter of time for you-ooh-ooh-ooh to-ooh-ooh-ooh
Tell me now, 'cause I've been up for I've been up for-

[Chorus]
Three nights at the motel under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want (want)
And you can call me names if you call me up (call me up)
Three nights at the motel under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
I can't fix each and all your problems, I'm no good with names & faces
And she sent me naked pictures from her neck down to the waist
I get my feelings involved, she stopped returnin' my calls
Her flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too far gone in all the wrong ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music, watchin' movies
Talkin' to the walls in my room, walkin through the halls in my head
Just tryna make sure it all makes sense, I ain't made of money
Maybe some day you can take it from me?
I'm up too late, thinkin' 'bout you and M.I.A for

[Chorus]
Three nights at the motel under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want (want)
And you can call me names if you call me up (call me up)
Three nights at the motel under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up (Ooh)
[Intro]
Better
Nothing, baby
Nothing feels better
I'm not really drunk, I never get that fucked up
I'm not, I'm so sober

[Verse 1]
Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are
(Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are)
I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark
(I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark)
No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored
(No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored)
'Cause I live down the street
So we meet when you need and it's yours
All I hear is...

[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I'll admit
Nothing feels better than this

[Verse 2]
You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around
(You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around)
You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?
(You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?)
'Cause I am
I got so high the other night, I swear to God, felt my feet lift the ground
(I got so high the other night, I swear to God I felt my feet lift the ground)
Ooh, yeah
Your back against the wall, this is all you've been talking about
In my ears

[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit
Nothing feels better than this

[Bridge]
Now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like

[Chorus]
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit
Nothing feels better than this (Better than this)

[Outro]
Nothing feels better than this

So I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight

Party, trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me is falling in love to our song

I, I, oh I, yeah

Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers
And when they leave, I go back to our song, I hold on

Hurts like heaven, lost in the sound
Buzz cut season like you're still around
Can't unmiss you and I need you now
Yeah, I, I, oh I, yeah

I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs

I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Verse 2]
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Bridge]
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got a juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)

[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Hoo, huh, uh, huhh-ow
Huh, huhh-huhhh

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now
[Verse 1]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
Two times clean again, I'm actin' low
A pound of weed and a bag of blow

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Verse 2]
I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to bleed
I'd let go, but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how, but I need to now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
(We could be) We could be more than just part-time lovers
(Part-time lovers, yeah)
(More than, more than lovers)
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Outro]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
[Verse 1]
You got me some type of way (Hmm)
Ain't used to feelin' this way (Mmm-mmm)
I do not know what to say (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one fuckin' look at your face (Hmm)
Now I wanna know how you taste (Mmm-mmm)
Usually don't give it away (Yeah, yeah)
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (Mornin')
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (Care)
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored

[Verse 2]
This shit always happen to me (Yeah)
Why can't we just play for keeps? (Mmm-mmm)
Practically on my knees (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
You know what you're doin' to me
You're singin' my songs in the streets, yeah, yeah
Actin' all innocent, please
When I know you out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you realize she's right there (Yeah)
And you're at home like, "Damn, she can't compare"

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (In the mornin')
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (I don't care, yee)
Break up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored

[Post-Chorus]
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend
With your girlfriend
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend

[Bridge]
You could say I'm hatin' if you want to
But I only hate on her 'cause I want you
Say I'm trippin' if you feel like
But you without me ain't right (Ain't right)
You could call me crazy 'cause I want you
And I never even ever fuckin' met you
Say I'm trippin' and it ain't right
But you without me ain't nice (Ain't nice, yeah)

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (Hit in the mornin', yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care (Care, yeah)
Break up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored

[Post-Chorus]
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, baby, girlfriend
With your girlfriend
With your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend
With your girlfriend
[Verse 1]
When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
When you're looking at my photos
Getting hot, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Now, now, now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

[Chorus]
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm here looking fine, babe
And I got eyes looking my way
And everybody's on my vibe, babe
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
My friends said you were a bad man
I should have listened to them back then
And now you're tryna hit me up again
Now, now, now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

[Chorus]
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up

[Bridge]
Don't call me up
So don't call me up
Don't call me up

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

[Chorus]
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up
[Verse 1]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Verse 2]
I think I see your face in every place that I go
I try to hide it, but I know that it's gonna show
Every single night, I find it harder to sleep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Outro]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
'Cause I need you here with me
[Intro]
Oooh, Oooh

[Verse 1]
My tongue is sealed within my mouth
These certain words they can’t come out
These thoughts are walking on their own
Dancing around with no control

[Pre-Chorus]
I know what I did to you was wrong
Hence why I’ve kept it for this long
Secrets have been brewing up a storm
Did not expect it to transform

[Chorus]
Soaked up in my brain
For another day
These things I'm tryna say
Get drenched and swept away, that's the truth
Soaked up in my brain
Don't know what to say
Something about you boy
You soak up half my brain, yes you do
Ooh, ooh, something about you boy
You soak up half my brain

[Post-Chorus]
You look at me like I hit you, ooh
Stole all your things then left you bruised, ooh
Look what I’ve got myself into, ooh
My words are stuck, my body too, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I know what I did to you was wrong, know what I did to you was wrong
Hence why I’ve kept it for this long, so long, so long
Secrets have been brewing up a storm, a storm
Did not expect it to transform

[Chorus]
Soaked up in my brain
For another day
These things I'm tryna say
Get drenched and swept away, that's the truth
Soaked up in my brain
Don't know what to say
Something about you boy
You soak up half my brain, yes you do
Ooh, ooh
Something about you boy
You soak up half my brain, yes you do
Ooh, ooh
Something about you boy
You soak up half my brain, yes you do

[Post-Chorus]
I know what I did to you was wrong, know what I did to you was wrong
Hence why I’ve kept it for this long, so long, so long
Secrets have been brewing up a storm, a storm
Did not expect it to transform, transform

[Chorus]
Soaked up in my brain
For another day
These things I'm tryna say
Get drenched and swept away, that's the truth
Soaked up in my brain
Don't know what to say
Something about you boy
You soak up half my brain, yes you do
(Ooh, ooh)
Something about you boy
You soak up half my brain, yes you do
(Ooh, ooh)
Something about you boy
You soak up half my brain, yes you do

[Outro]
(Ooh, ooh)
[Intro]
You good, T-Minus?

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Verse 2]
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Outro]
Money in your palm don't make you real
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
Money in your palm don't make you real

[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Bridge]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Outro]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
[Intro]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 1]
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 2]
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
My god is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now

[Outro]
Haha!
I cannot do this snowflake
[Verse 1]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

[Pre-Chorus]
Said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

[Bridge]
You don't have to say just what you did (What you did)
I already know (I know)
I had to go and find out from them (Oh-woah)
So tell me, how's it feel? (Oh-woah)

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
[Intro]
Get to roll no...
Ayy, I'm in the studio, bro
Oh, nah, yeah, call me, ball me
Yeah, I'll... bet
Yeah, I'm at the studio, hold up though

[Verse 1]
I ain't get to roll no weed, I ain't get to roll no Swishers
I was locked up on Christmas, ain't get to see my niggas
Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time

[Chorus]
I wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind (I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind

[Verse 2]
Yellow tape around his body, it's a fucking homicide
His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him it's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind
(I got murder on my mind)

[Verse 3]
Bite like tarantula, bitch, I'm an animal
Melly's a savage, no he not no amateur
Bad bitch named Angela, fucked her on camera
Bitch I'm a murderer (Yeah, yeah)
I might just kill the boy, don't wanna kill the boy
Bake him up, say he want beef, we gon' grill the boy
(Grill the boy, we gonna grill the boy)
I'm bleeding so good, I might dip his ass in it and spill the boy
Haha, murder on my mind, whoa, whoa
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind, huh

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind
(Murder on my mind)

[Outro]

Say my name in your song and it's lit, yeah
Been waiting for a nigga like this, yeah
We got London On Da Track
[Verse 1]
Home grown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar
I could get used to this

[Pre-Chorus]
Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be

[Chorus]
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone

[Verse 2]
South of the Equator, navigator
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
And deep sea divin' 'round the clock, bikini bottoms, lager tops
I could get used to this

[Pre-Chorus]
Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be

[Chorus]
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone

Two in the back
Sailin' along
And we don't look back
(Back, back, back-back-back-back...)

[Pre-Chorus]
Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be

[Chorus]
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone, a someone, a someone, a someone...
[Intro: Jennie, Lisa]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA!
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Jennie]
천사 같은 "hi" 끝엔 악마 같은 "bye"
매번 미칠듯한 high 뒤엔 뱉어야 하는 price
이건 답이 없는 test
매번 속더라도 yes
딱한 감정의 노예
얼어 죽을 사랑해, eh

[Verse 2: Lisa]
Here I come kickin' the door, uh
가장 독한 걸로 줘, uh
뻔하디 뻔한 그 love, love
더 내놔봐 give me some more
알아서 매달려 벼랑 끝에
한마디면 또 like 헤벌레 해
그 따뜻한 떨림이 새빨간 설렘이
마치 heaven 같겠지만
You might not get in it

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo & Rosé]
Look at me, look at you
누가 더 아플까
You smart 누가 you are
두 눈에 피눈물 흐르게 된다면
So sorry 누가 you are
나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어
애써 두 눈을 가린 채
사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어

[Chorus: All, Lisa, Jennie]
Let's kill this love!
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Let's kill this love!
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

[Verse 3: Jennie, Lisa]
Feelin' like a sinner
It's so fire with him I go boo, hoo
He said "you look crazy"
Thank you, baby
I owe it all to you
Got me all messed up
His love is my favorite
But you plus me
Sadly can be dangerous

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé & Jisoo]
Lucky me, lucky you
결국엔 거짓말 we lie
So what? So what?
만약에 내가 널 지우게
된다면 so sorry
I'm not sorry
나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어
애써 눈물을 감춘 채, eh
사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어

[Chorus: All, Lisa, Jennie]
Let's kill this love!
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Let's kill this love!
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

[Bridge: Rosé]
We all commit to love
That makes you cry, oh oh
We're all making love
That kills you inside, yeah

[Outro: All]
We must kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Before it kills you too
Kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Gotta kill, let's kill this love!
[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Khalid]
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (Found)
But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish & Khalid]
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

[Chorus: Billie Eilish with Khalid]
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

[Verse 2: Khalid with Billie Eilish]
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish & Khalid]
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

[Chorus: Billie Eilish with Khalid]
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

[Intro]
No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There’s a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn

[Verse 1]
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin’ to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Interlude]
I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life

[Verse 2]
Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever ’cause I don’t self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it (Teh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you’re the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Bridge]
Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my— asking about my motto

[Interlude]
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right?

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Outro]
Did you like it? Did you like that?
Um, which part?
[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 1]
She'll make you curse, but she a blessing
She'll rip your shirt within a second
You'll be coming back, back for seconds
With your plate, you just can't help it

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying, "No, no"
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 2]
See, someone said, "Don't drink her potions
She'll kiss your neck with no emotion
When she's mean, you know you love it
She tastes so sweet, don't sugarcoat it"

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying, "No (No, no, no), no (No)"
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Bridge]
You're just like me, you're out your mind
I know it's strange, we're both the crazy kind
You're tellin' me that I'm insane
Boy, don't pretend that you don't love the pain

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
[Verse 1]
This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Verse 2]
Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Bridge]
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Verse 1]
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share

[Chorus]
I'm in their second hand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Interlude]
Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god
(And it's like, wait, like, when?)

[Verse 2]
Wakin' up at sundown (Ooh)
They're late to every party (Ooh)
Nobody's ever sorry (Ooh)
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down (Come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (Hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (Learning)
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance

[Chorus]
I'm in their second hand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Bridge]
Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake

[Outro]
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doin' nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Come down
Hurting
Learning
[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the whispers all across the room?
You feel her eyes all over you like cheap perfume
You're beautiful, but misunderstood
So why you tryna be just like the neighborhood?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see ya, I know what you're feelin'
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret
I'm a little crazy underneath this
Underneath this

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Verse 2]
Oh so, dress up fancy like Sid and Nancy (Yeah)
Walkin' Killer Queen, gotta keep 'em guessin'
So baby come pass me a lighter
We're gonna leave 'em on fire
We're the sinners and the blessings

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see ya, I know what you're feelin'
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret
I'm a little crazy underneath this
Underneath this, ooh

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Bridge]
(Ah-ah-ah)
You're king and you're queen
You're strong then you're weak
You're bound but so free
(Ah-ah-ah)
So come and join me
And call me Harley
And we'll make 'em scream

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)
[Verse 1]
There's somethin' in the way you roll your eyes
Takes me back to a better time
When I saw everything is good
But now you're the only thing that's good
Tryna stand up on my own two feet
This conversation ain't coming easily
And darlin', I know it's getting late
So what do you say we leave this place?

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

[Verse 2]
There's somethin' in the way I wanna cry
That makes me think we'll make it out alive
So come on and show me how we're good
I think that we could do some good, mhm

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
'Cause I can't be alone with all that's on my mind
Say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong, there is so much wrong
There is so much wrong goin' on outside

[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin'—

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Said thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fucking—

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)

[Verse 1]
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Verse 2]
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)

[Bridge]
You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown (You should see me, see me)
Your silence is my favorite sound (You should see me, see me)
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one
[Verse 1]
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal
Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape

[Chorus]
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Bridge]
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around

[Chorus]
For now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

But now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Outro]
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
[Hook]
I wanna be your one and only
So I'm sending you these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes

[Verse 1]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I saw you came along
I felt me something strong
The room was kinda hazy
Been smokin', drinkin' lately
And then you turned around
I looked you up and down
Just aks my heart about it
It's goin' crazy, I'm...

[Pre-Hook]
Sending all these vibes to you
I'm a loaded gun, got my aim on you
I'm lucky that my wish came true
It turns out, that you ain't bulletproof

[Hook]
I wanna be your one and only
So I'm sending you these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes

I wanna be your one and only
So I'm sending you these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes

[Verse 2]
And then the moment came
It took my breath away
Not just a pretty face
I ain't that type to chase
But I'm a sucker for, someone with something more
Just aks my heart about it
Still going crazy, I'm...

[Pre-Hook]
Getting all these vibes from you
Got the loaded gun
I hope your aim is true
Nothing else that I can do
It turns out, that I ain't bulletproof

[Hook]
I wanna be your one and only
So I'm sending you these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes

I wanna be your one and only
So I'm sending you these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes

[Refrain]
Vibes...(6x) (Sendin' all these vibes) Vibes...Vibes... (Sendin' all these vibes)

[Bridge]
I'm sending all these vibes to you
I'm lucky that my wish came true

[Hook]
I wanna be your one and only
So I'm sending you these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes

I wanna be your one and only
So I'm sending you these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes

I wanna be your one and only
So I'm sending you these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes

I wanna be your one and only
So I'm sending you these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes
[Verse 1]
Babe, don't make a sound
2 a.m. love gotta keep it down (keep it down)
Don't wait around for a signal now
Gimme some verbs, I ain't talkin' nouns (I'm naughty)
You wanna ride in the Six
You wanna dine in the Six (dine in the Six)
But when I lean for the kiss
You said I'll probably send you some pics
And I'm like

[Verse 2]
Babe, just hit the pedal
If things goin' wrong it's just incidental
My bad, never got the memo
But you never have fun while you're in the limo, yeah
If you wanna ride in the Six
You wanna dine in the Six (dine in the Six)
But when I lean for the kiss
You said I'll probably send you some pics
And I'm like

[Pre-Chorus]
