[Intro: Jennie, Lisa]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA!
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Jennie]
천사 같은 "hi" 끝엔 악마 같은 "bye"
매번 미칠듯한 high 뒤엔 뱉어야 하는 price
이건 답이 없는 test
매번 속더라도 yes
딱한 감정의 노예
얼어 죽을 사랑해, eh

[Verse 2: Lisa]
Here I come kickin' the door, uh
가장 독한 걸로 줘, uh
뻔하디 뻔한 그 love, love
더 내놔봐 give me some more
알아서 매달려 벼랑 끝에
한마디면 또 like 헤벌레 해
그 따뜻한 떨림이 새빨간 설렘이
마치 heaven 같겠지만
You might not get in it

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo & Rosé]
Look at me, look at you
누가 더 아플까
You smart 누가 you are
두 눈에 피눈물 흐르게 된다면
So sorry 누가 you are
나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어
애써 두 눈을 가린 채
사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어

[Chorus: All, Lisa, Jennie]
Let's kill this love!
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Let's kill this love!
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

[Verse 3: Jennie, Lisa]
Feelin' like a sinner
It's so fire with him I go boo, hoo
He said "you look crazy"
Thank you, baby
I owe it all to you
Got me all messed up
His love is my favorite
But you plus me
Sadly can be dangerous

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé & Jisoo]
Lucky me, lucky you
결국엔 거짓말 we lie
So what? So what?
만약에 내가 널 지우게
된다면 so sorry
I'm not sorry
나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어
애써 눈물을 감춘 채, eh
사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어

[Chorus: All, Lisa, Jennie]
Let's kill this love!
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Let's kill this love!
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

[Bridge: Rosé]
We all commit to love
That makes you cry, oh oh
We're all making love
That kills you inside, yeah

[Outro: All]
We must kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Before it kills you too
Kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Gotta kill, let's kill this love!
[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa

[Verse 1: Lauv]
Party, trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me is falling in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it, taking a shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think that they make anything that strong, so I hold on
I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers
And when they leave, I go back to our song, I hold on
I, I, oh I
Hurts like heaven, lost in the sound
Buzz cut season like you're still around
Can't unmiss you and I need you now
Yeah, I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv & Troye Sivan]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
I'm so tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love songs (Someone take me home)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home ('Cause I can't be alone)
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs ('Cause I'm so tired)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
[Intro]
Yeah, I been thinking a lot yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been way too long, since I seen you, looked you in your eyes
Riding round the town and staying out, don't wanna say goodbye
Everything's so different now, you're just what I'm missing now
But I know that I can't have you back, I guess I'm trippin' now

[Chorus]
Sometimes I start missin' you crazy, ain't nothing quite like you (yeah)
Love like this keeps goin' and goin', I cannot forget you (no)
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ride around town in a hoopty (uh)
Way before I ever had a groupie (uh)
Back when I used to wear the same five shirts
Way before I ever had Gucci (uh)
Way before I ever had a Rollie on
Talking back when I dropped Corleone
Picking up an eighth that my homie got
Fuckin' in the car, that's the only spot
Back when I felt more free, back when I smoked more weed
Back when I drove up and down 92, with a view of the moon and you in my passenger seat
That was so good, now it's all gone
It is what it is 'cause we both moved on
At least we, have memories, and we also got this song (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been way too long, since I seen you, looked you in your eyes
Riding round the town and staying out, don't wanna say goodbye
Everything's so different now, you're just what I'm missin now
But I know that I can't have you back, I guess I'm trippin' now

[Chorus]
Sometimes I start missin' you crazy, ain't nothing quite like you (yeah)
Love like this keeps goin' and goin', I cannot forget you (no)
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, if you saw me now
Would you recognize me or would you call me out?
I know it's been a while but I'm still me
But honestly it's been so long that I wouldn't be offended if you didn't even feel me
There's a gap now, big enough to make us forget how we felt in the past now
Everything moves so fast now, damn
I miss things going slower, I miss us being closer
I mean I got a good thing but I feel like I don't even really know her
This a new life, I didn't do you right
But I got a second chance to improve my appreciation, I should take it
I'm sorry that I ever got jaded, for real

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been way too long, since I seen you, looked you in your eyes
Riding round the town and stayin' out, don't wanna say goodbye
Everything's so different now, you’re just what I'm missin' now
But I know that I can't have you back, I guess I'm trippin' now

[Chorus]
Sometimes I start missin' you crazy, ain't nothing quite like you (yeah)
Love like this keeps goin' and goin', I cannot forget you (no)
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh
[Verse 1]
I want to lay down by the fire with you
Where souls are glowing, ever warmer too
Your love surrounds me like a lullaby
Singing softly, you are mine, oh mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Moon has never glowed this color
Hearts have never been this close
I have never been more certain
I will love you 'til we're old

[Chorus]
Maybe the night
Holds a little hope for us, dear
Maybe we might
Want to settle down, just be near
Stay together here

[Hook]
We follow the pull of fate, into this moment
We follow the pull of fate, into this moment

[Pre-Chorus]
Moon has never glowed this color
Hearts have never been this close
I have never been more certain
I will love you 'til we're old

[Chorus]
Maybe the night holds a little hope for us, dear
Maybe we might want to settle down, just be near
Stay together

[Chorus]
Maybe the night holds a little hope for us, dear
Maybe we might want to settle down, just be near
Maybe the night holds a little hope for us, dear
Maybe we might want to settle down, just be near
Stay together
Stay together
Here
[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, started off right
I can see it in your eyes
I can tell that you're wantin' more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

[Refrain]
Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts (Yeah)
Can't get what we want without knowin' (No)
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 2]
Oh, nah
Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room
I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock

[Refrain]
Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Outro]
Figure out where we're goin'
[Verse 1]
There's no reason, there's no rhyme
I found myself blindsided by
A feeling that I've never known
I'm dealing with it on my own
Phone is quiet, walls are bare
I drink myself to sleep, who cares?
No one even has to know
I'm dealing with it on my own

[Chorus]
I've got way too much time to be this hurt
Somebody help, it's getting worse
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light fades, everything is dark
Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time?

[Verse 2]
Heavy thoughts when it gets late
Put me in a fragile state
I wish I wasn't going home
Dealing with it on my own
I'm praying but it's not enough
I'm done, I don't believe in love
Learning how to let it go
Dealing with it on my own

[Chorus]
I've got way too much time to be this hurt
Somebody help, it's getting worse
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light fades, everything is dark
Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time? Yeah

[Refrain]
I drive circles under street lights
Nothing seems to clear my mind
I can't forget
Get this out my head, so
I drive, chasing Malibu nights
Nothing seems to heal my mind
I can't forget

[Chorus]
I've got way too much time to be this hurt
Somebody help, it's getting worse
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light fades, everything is dark
Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time? Yeah

[Refrain]
I drive circles under street lights
Nothing seems to clear my mind
I can't forget
Get this out my head, so
I drive, chasing Malibu nights
Nothing seems to heal my mind
I can't forget
(Get this out my head, so)
I drive, chasing Malibu nights
Hey, yeah, na-na, ah yeah
[Intro: H.E.R.]
Oh, hey

[Verse 1: H.E.R.]
You don't know babe
When you hold me
And kiss me slowly
It's the sweetest thing
And it don't change
If I had it my way
You would know that you are

[Pre-Chorus 1: H.E.R.]
You're the coffee that I need in the morning
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
Won't you give yourself to me
Give it all, oh

[Chorus: H.E.R. & Daniel Caesar]
I just wanna see
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie

Oh you're the best part, oh
Then you're the best part, ooh
Best part

[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
It's this sunrise
And those brown eyes, yes
You're the one that I desire
When we wake up
And then we make love (make love)
It makes me feel so nice

[Pre-Chorus 2: Daniel Caesar]
You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts
You're the sunshine on my life

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar & H.E.R.]
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Then you're the best part, oh
You're the best part, ooh
Best part

[Outro: Daniel Caesar & H.E.R.]
If you love me, won't you say something?
If you love me, won't you?
Won't you?
If you love me, won't you say something?
If you love me, won't you?
Love me, won't you?
If you love me, won't you say something?
If you love me, won't you?
If you love me, won't you say something?
If you love me, won't you?
Love me, won't you?
If you love me, won't you say something?
If you love me, won't you?
If you love me, won't you say something?
If you love me, won't you?
Love me, won't you?
[Verse 1]
There are days
I wake up and I pinch myself
You're with me, not someone else
And I'm scared, yeah, I'm still scared
That it's all a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you still look perfect as days go by
Even the worst ones, you make me smile
I'd stop the world if it gave us time

[Chorus]
'Cause when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do

[Verse 2]
When you say
You love the way I make you feel
Everything becomes so real
Don't be scared, no, don't be scared
'Cause you're all I need

[Pre-Chorus]
And you still look perfect as days go by
Even the worst ones, you make me smile
I'd stop the world if it gave us time

[Chorus]
'Cause when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do

[Bridge]
All my life
I thought it'd be hard to find
The one, 'til I found you
And I find it bittersweet
'Cause you gave me something to lose

[Chorus]
But when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do
[Intro: Sam Smith]
Hmm, mhm

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
I don't wanna be alone tonight (Alone tonight)
It's pretty clear that I'm not over you (Over you, over you)
I'm still thinking 'bout the things you do (Things you do)

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
We go together
Better than birds of a feather, you and me
We change the weather, yeah
I'm feelin' heat in December when you're 'round me

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough

And, baby, you know it's obvious

[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I'm a sucker for you
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly

[Verse 1: V]
내가 날 눈치챘던 순간
떠나야만 했어
난 찾아내야 했어
All day all night

[Verse 2: Jimin]
사막과 바다들을 건너
넓고 넓은 세계를
헤매어 다녔어
Baby I

[Refrain: Jungkook]
I could make it better
I could hold you tighter
그 먼 길 위에서
Oh you’re the light

[Verse 4: V]
초대받지 못한
환영받지 못한
나를 알아줬던 단 한 사람

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
끝도 보이지 않던 영원의 밤
내게 아침을 선물한 건 너야
이제 그 손 내가 잡아도 될까
Oh oh
I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Verse 5: J-Hope]
이 세상 속에 영웅이 된 나
나를 찾는 큰 환호와
내 손, 트로피와 금빛 마이크
All day, everywhere
But 모든 게 너에게 닿기 위함인 걸
내 여정의 답인 걸
널 찾기 위해 노래해
Baby to you

[Verse 6: RM]
전보다 조금 더 커진 키에
좀 더 단단해진 목소리에
모든 건 네게 돌아가기 위해
이제 너라는 지도를 활짝 펼칠게
My rehab
날 봐 왜 못 알아봐
남들의 아우성 따위 나 듣고 싶지 않아
너의 향기는 여전히 나를 꿰뚫어 무너뜨려
되돌아가자 그때로

[Refrain: Jin]
Baby I know
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
그 모든 길은 널
향한 거야

[Verse 7: Jimin]
다 소용없었어
너 아닌 다른 건
그때처럼 날 어루만져줘

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
끝도 보이지 않던 영원의 밤
내게 아침을 선물한 건 너야
이제 그 손 내가 잡아도 될까
Oh oh
I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Bridge: Suga]
여전히 아름다운 너
그날의 그때처럼 말없이 그냥 날 안아줘
지옥에서 내가 살아 남은 건
날 위했던 게 아닌 되려 너를 위한 거란 걸
안다면 주저 말고 please save my life
너 없이 헤쳐왔던 사막 위는 목말라
그러니 어서 빨리 날 잡아줘
너 없는 바다는 결국 사막과 같을 거란 걸 알아

[Refrain: Jimin, Jungkook]
All right
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
Oh I can make it right

[Outro: V, Jimin]
다 소용없었어
너 아닌 다른 건
Oh I can make it right

[Jungkook, Jimin, V]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right
[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Jennie]
잠깐 누가 시간을 좀 멈춰봐
뭔가 크게 어긋난 걸 난 느껴

[Verse 2: Lisa]
애써 어색하게 웃어보다
이젠 그런 내가 안쓰러워

[Pre-Chorus 1: Rosé]
아냐 괜찮다고 말하지만
Don’t know what to do without you
하찮은 이곳에 홀로 남아
그려본 네 기억은 blue

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jisoo]
사람은 변해 왜 나만 이래
오늘처럼 예쁜 날에
어떻게 이렇게 모든 게 벅차기만 해
Don’t know what to do

[Chorus: Rosé, Jisoo & Lisa]
I don’t know what to do without you
Yeah, hey, hey
I don’t know what to do without you
Yeah, hey, hey
I don’t know what to do without you, uh, uh, uh
You, uh, uh, uh
You, uh, uh, uh
You know, I don’t know what to do
Don’t know what to do

[Verse 3: Jisoo]
잠깐 왔다 떠난 사람들처럼
그냥 우린 아니었던 거지 뭐

[Verse 4: Jennie & Lisa]
혹시라도 전화가 울릴까 봐
괜한 기댈 하는 내가 미워
자꾸 똑딱 거리는 시계 소리가
유난히 거슬려

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jennie]
꽤나 멀쩡해 보이지만
Don’t know what to do without you
이런 내 맘 거울에 들킬까 봐
그려본 내 입술은 blue

[Pre-Chorus 2: Rosé & Jennie]
혼자가 편해 난 그냥 그래
오늘처럼 예쁜 날에
어떻게 이렇게 모든 게 벅차기만 해
Don’t know what to do

[Chorus: Jennie, Jisoo & Lisa]
I don’t know what to do without you
Yeah, hey, hey
I don’t know what to do without you
Yeah, hey, hey
I don’t know what to do without you, uh, uh, uh
You, uh, uh, uh
You, uh, uh, uh
You know, I don’t know what to do
Don’t know what to do without you

[Outro: Rosé]
아냐 괜찮다고 말하지만
Don’t know what to do without you
하찮은 이곳에 홀로 남아
그려본 네 기억은 blue
[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got a juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)
[Verse 1]
I might lose my mind
Waking when the sun's down
Riding all these highs
Waiting for the comedown
Walk these streets with me
I'm doing decently
Just glad that I can breathe, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying to realise
It's alright to not be fine on your own

[Chorus]
Now I'm shaking, drinking all this coffee
These last few weeks have been exhausting
I'm lost in my imagination
And there's one thing that I need from you

[Hook]
Can you come through, through
Through, yeah
And there's one thing that I need from you
Can you come through?

[Verse 2]
Ain't got much to do
Too old for my hometown
Went to bed at noon
Couldn't put my phone down
Scrolling patiently
It's all the same to me
Just faces on a screen, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying to realise
It's alright to not be fine on your own

[Chorus]
Now I'm shaking, drinking all this coffee
These last few weeks have been exhausting
I'm lost in my imagination
And there's one thing that I need from you

[Hook]
Can you come through, through
Through, yeah
And there's one thing that I need from you
Can you come through?

[Outro]
Through, through
Through, yeah
And there's one thing that I need from you
Can you come through?
[Intro: RM]
I'm exhausted man
Oh, guess what?
I just want to go home

[Verse 1: Jimin, RM]
미칠듯한 설레임에
인사조차 못했어 (yeah, right)
Yeah I’m going out baby
온 세상이 내 집

[Verse 2: V, RM]
Crazy for myself (yeah)
저 문을 열면 뭐든 다 될 것처럼 (right)
마치 무슨 본때를 보여줄 것처럼 (uh huh)
집을 나섰지
(이 모든 상상이 다 신기루로 끝나지 않길)

[Verse 3: RM]
Oh yeah I did it, me shine with flashin' lights
Got lotta friends, 고즈넉한 내 공간
그래 기억해 뭐든 다 할 수 있을 것만 같던 때
I saw the ocean yeah 이 문을 열기도 전에
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, Jin]
뭔가 채울수록 더 비어가
함께일수록 더 혼자인 것 같아
반쯤 감긴 눈, 잠 못 드는 밤
니가 있는 곳

[Chorus: V, Jin, RM]
아마 그곳이 Mi Casa
With you I'mma feel rich
바로 그곳이 Mi Casa
미리 켜둬 너의 switch
Yeah

[Post-Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, V, RM]
말을 안 해도 편안할 거야
너만 있다면 다 내 집이 될 거야
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that
Home

[Refrain: Jimin, Jungkook]
Your love your love your love (I miss that)
Your love your love your love (I want that)
Your touch your touch your touch (I need that)
La la la la la la la la I love it

[Verse 4: J-Hope]
불 꺼진 현관에 내 발이 이상해
눈 감고 이불 안에 있어도 이상해
둥 붕 뜬 기분 빙 도는 두 눈
이 멋진 공간에 나 완전 초라해

[Verse 5: Suga]
완전 초라해
세상은 우리가 세상을 다 가진 줄 아는군
꿈에 그리던 Big house, big cars, big rings
내가 원한 건 모든 걸 가져도
뭔가 허전한 지금 모든 걸 이룬 자가 느낀 낯선 기분
But 지금 떠나도 돌아올 곳이 있기에 나서는 문

[Bridge: Jin]
갈림길에서 자꾸 생각나
볼품없던 날 알아줬던 너
니 생각에 웃을 수 있었어
니가 있는 곳

[Chorus: Jimin, V]
아마 그곳이 Mi Casa
With you I’mma feel rich
바로 그곳이 Mi Casa
미리 켜둬 너의 switch
Yeah

[Post-Chorus: Jimin, V]
말을 안 해도 편안할 거야
너만 있다면 다 내 집이 될 거야
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that
Home

[Verse 6: Jimin, Jungkook, Jin]
그 언젠가
초인종이 세 번 울리면
문을 열어주겠니
미처 못한 인사를 전할 수 있게
그땐 말할게

[Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
오랜만이야 Mi Casa
With you I just feel rich
다녀왔어 Hi Mi Casa
켜뒀구나 너의 switch
Yeah

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin]
말을 안 해도 편안하잖아
니가 있어서 나의 집이 된 거야
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that
Home

[Refrain: Jungkook, V, Jimin]
Your love your love your love (I miss that)
Your love your love your love (I want that)
Your touch your touch your touch (I need that)
La la la la la la la la I love it
[Intro]
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

[Verse 1]
No, I don't say it often
And I probably should’ve told you I hurt this bad, I know
And I probably shouldn't want this so bad
It's weighing, weighing on me
Don’t wanna wake up in the mornin'
Cannot undo what we did in this bed
And I can't get you out, so I gotta go
No, I'm not ready for, you want me all alone

[Chorus]
But I'm undecided, excited, ignited
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flying
But I'm still indecisive
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

[Verse 2]
I know I shouldn’t be doing this, but here we go again
Girl, you know that pussy is my weakness (Weakness, weakness, weakness)
Girl, you got me addicted when you switching positions
You tell me, "Shut up"
And you know I listen, I hate it
Wish I never did it
I can’t keep sinning and pretending (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm taking off your clothes
We getting sexual
Hit it so good, think I’ll propose
I don't know but

[Chorus]
I'm undecided, excited (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), ignited (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flying (All these, all these)
But I’m still indecisive ('Cause you want me)
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

[Bridge]
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Oh, no, I'm undecided
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, yeah
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, I said I just don't know
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Ayy, 'cause I'm undecided
No, no, baby
I'm afraid of your love
Oh, ooh, you got me, baby
'Cause I can't get enough, oh, woah

[Chorus]
I'm undecided, excited (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), ignited (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, huh)
And I don't wanna feel the way I do, but I like it
Look at all these sparks flying
But I'm still indecisive
And she want me to wife it
But I'm undecided

[Outro]
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
No, no, oh, no, and I want it (I'm undecided)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, ayy
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, no, no, no, no
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, but I'm undecided
[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad

[Verse 1: Jin]
또 져버린 것 같아
넌 화가 나 보여
아른대는 Game over over over

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
만약 게임이라면
또 load하면 되겠지만
I guess I gotta deal with this, deal with this
Real world

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
차라리 게임이면 좋겠지
너무 아프니까
I need to heal my medic
But I’m another star
완벽하지 못했던 나를 탓해
Brake in my head, brake in my step, always
그저 잘하고 싶었고
웃게 해주고 싶었는데.. damn

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
Please give me a remedy
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
이제 어떻게 해야 해
날 살려줘 다시 기회를 줘
Please give me

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
A remedy, a melody
오직 내게만 남겨질 그 memory
이쯤에서 그만하면
꺼버리면 모든 게 다 편해질까

[Verse 4: Jin]
괜찮지만 괜찮지 않아
익숙하다고 혼잣말했지만
늘 처음인 것처럼 아파

[Verse 5: J-Hope]
부족한 gamer, 맞아 날 control 못하지
계속 아파 ‘Cause 시행착오와 오만 가지
내 노래 가사, 몸짓 하나
말 한마디 다 내 미시감에 무서워지고
또 늘 도망가려 해
But 잡네, 그래도 네가
내 그림자는 커져가도 내 삶과 넌 equal sign
So 내 remedy는 your remedy

[Chorus: Jin, Jungkook]
Please give me a remedy
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
이제 어떻게 해야 해
날 살려줘 다시 기회를 줘
Please give me a

[Bridge: Jin, Jungkook]
(Remedy)
또 다시 뛰고, 또 넘어지고
(Honestly)
수없이 반복된대도
난 또 뛸 거라고

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
So give me a remedy
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
이제 어떻게 해야 해
날 살려줘 다시 기회를 줘

[Outro: Jungkook, Jin, J-Hope]
Please give me a remedy
(성공인가. 돌아왔어)
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
(집중해서 꼭 네게 닿고 말겠어. 떨어지고, 넘어지고)
이제 어떻게 해야 해
(익숙한 아픔이 똑같이 날 덮쳐)
날 살려줘
(이번에도 쉽지 않아)
다시 기회를 줘
(관둘 거냐고? No, no never)
I won’t give up
[Verse 1]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

[Pre-Chorus]
Said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

[Bridge]
You don't have to say just what you did (What you did)
I already know (I know)
I had to go and find out from them (Oh-woah)
So tell me, how's it feel? (Oh-woah)

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Bridge]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Outro]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

다 빠져 빠져 빠져 미친 예술가에
한 잔 (one shot) 두 잔 (two shots)
예술에 취해 불러 옹헤야

[Chorus: Jin, V, Jhope]
다 마셔 마셔 마셔 마셔 내 술잔 ay
다 빠져 빠져 빠져 미친 예술가에
한 잔 (one shot) 두 잔 (two shots)
꽹과리 치며 불러 옹헤야

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook, RM, Jimin]
술잔 (sippin’), 팔짱 (tippin’)
티르소스 (grippin’), 포도 (eatin’)
분위기 (keep it), D style (rip it)
여기 (kill it) let’s steal it
The illest

[Outro: Jungkook, J-Hope, Jin]
술잔 (sippin’), 팔짱 (tippin’)
티르소스 (grippin’), 포도 (eatin’)
분위기 (keep it), D style (rip it)
여기 (kill it) let’s steal it
The illest
[Verse 1]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Verse 2]
I think I see your face in every place that I go
I try to hide it, but I know that it's gonna show
Every single night, I find it harder to sleep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Outro]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
'Cause I need you here with me
[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 1]
She'll make you curse, but she a blessing
She'll rip your shirt within a second
You'll be coming back, back for seconds
With your plate, you just can't help it

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying, "No, no"
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 2]
See, someone said, "Don't drink her potions
She'll kiss your neck with no emotion
When she's mean, you know you love it
She tastes so sweet, don't sugarcoat it"

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying, "No (No, no, no), no (No)"
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Bridge]
You're just like me, you're out your mind
I know it's strange, we're both the crazy kind
You're tellin' me that I'm insane
Boy, don't pretend that you don't love the pain

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
[Verse 1: Jennie]
결론이 뭔데 또 그래서
어쩌겠다는 건데 I’ll break your, break your heart
Never asked for much
애써 노력 따윈 마, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Lisa]
쉽게 뱉은 말 주워 담지마
I ain’t nothin' like the same, same girls that you’ve had
그래 난 멋대로 해

[Pre-Chorus 1: Rosé & Jisoo]
어두운 밤이 날 감싸지만
이제서야 나를 위해서 춤을 출 수 있어
너란 벽을 넘어서
I’ll kick it if you’re down, kick it if you down

[Chorus: Jennie & Lisa]
Can I kick it? (Yeah!)
캄캄한 저 하늘 위에
한바탕 난리를 치며 불을 지를 거야
Can I kick it? (Yeah!)
너라는 세상을 부숴버리고
나 환하게 눈부셔 버릴 거야

[Post-Chorus: Rosé & Jisoo]
And I’m letting it all out
잃을 건 없잖아
이젠 나를 찾을 거라고
나 혼자여도 괜찮아
불쌍해하지 마
이젠 너를 잊을 거라고

[Verse 3: Lisa]
Never needed nothin’ else
Just a lil' love from myself
When you couldn’t be the one to help
Had to kick it and I did it
Tell whoever you wanna tell
Get kicked to the curb, ya kicked out
Never kick a girl when she kicked down
Who you gon' kiss now?
Know you gon' miss how I move
From the top to the bottom of my kicks now

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo & Rosé]
어두운 밤이 날 감싸지만
이제서야 나를 위해서 춤을 출 수 있어
너란 벽을 넘어서
I’ll kick it if you’re down, kick it if you down

[Chorus: Jennie & Lisa]
Can I kick it? (Yeah!)
캄캄한 저 하늘 위에
한바탕 난리를 치며 불을 지를 거야
Can I kick it? (Yeah!)
너라는 세상을 부숴버리고
나 환하게 눈부셔 버릴 거야

[Post-Chorus: Rosé & Jisoo]
And I’m letting it all out
잃을 건 없잖아
이젠 나를 찾을 거라고
나 혼자여도 괜찮아
불쌍해하지 마
이젠 너를 잊을 거라고

[Bridge: Jennie]
결론이 뭔데 또 그래서
어쩌겠다는 건데
답답한 너의 세상에서 벗어나
높이 날아갈 테니까

[Outro]
I’ll kick it how I wanna kick it
When I wanna kick it
No, you can’t tell me not to kick it
'Cause I’m 'bout to kick it
I’ll kick it how I wanna kick it
When I wanna kick it
No, you can’t tell me not to kick it
'Cause I’m 'bout to kick it

[Outro 2: Rosé & Jisoo]
And I’m letting it all out
잃을 건 없잖아
이젠 나를 찾을 거라고
나 혼자여도 괜찮아
불쌍해하지 마
이젠 너를 잊을 거라고

Even though you don't even smoke
Always changin' your access codes
Yeah, I can tell you no one knew

[Verse 1]
I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)
Uh, we were only 11
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, "Love is forever and ever"
Well, I guess that was true

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

[Chorus]
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs

[Verse 2]
Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to 2002 (ooh)
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

[Chorus]
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
Oh, now

[Chorus]
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love, love, love
