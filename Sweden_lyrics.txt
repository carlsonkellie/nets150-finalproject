[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad

We go together
Better than birds of a feather, you and me
We change the weather, yeah
I'm feelin' heat in December when you're 'round me

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I'm a sucker for you
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (About you), about you (About you)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got a juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)

[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa

[Verse 1: Lauv]
Party, trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me is falling in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it, taking a shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think that they make anything that strong, so I hold on
I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers
And when they leave, I go back to our song, I hold on
I, I, oh I
Hurts like heaven, lost in the sound
Buzz cut season like you're still around
Can't unmiss you and I need you now
Yeah, I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv & Troye Sivan]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
I'm so tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love songs (Someone take me home)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home ('Cause I can't be alone)
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs ('Cause I'm so tired)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa

I'm still thinking 'bout the things you do (Things you do)
So I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight
Can you light the fire? (Light the fire, light the fire)
I need somebody who can take control (Take control)

[Chorus: Conor Maynard]
Remember when I told you
"No matter where I go
I'll never leave your side
You will never be alone"
Even when we go through changes
Even when we're old
Remember that I told you
I'll find my way back home

[Verse 1: Conor Maynard]
I could never let you go
Couldn't run away if I tried
'Cause even when I'm all alone
You still got a hold on my mind
And I'll always let you know
That I'm always gonna hold on

[Pre-Chorus: Conor Maynard]
And I told you right from the start
You just say the word and I'll go
No, it doesn't matter how far
'Cause your love is all that I know
Baby, you just stay where you are
And you know I won't be too long
Hold on
Hold on

[Chorus: Conor Maynard]
Remember when I told you
"No matter where I go
I'll never leave your side
You will never be alone"
Even when we go through changes
Even when we're old

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the whispers all across the room?
You feel her eyes all over you like cheap perfume
You're beautiful, but misunderstood
So why you tryna be just like the neighborhood?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see ya, I know what you're feelin'
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret
I'm a little crazy underneath this
Underneath this

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Verse 2]
Oh so, dress up fancy like Sid and Nancy (Yeah)
Walkin' Killer Queen, gotta keep 'em guessin'
So baby come pass me a lighter
We're gonna leave 'em on fire
We're the sinners and the blessings

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see ya, I know what you're feelin'
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret
I'm a little crazy underneath this
Underneath this, ooh

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different

You're king and you're queen
You're strong then you're weak
You're bound but so free
(Ah-ah-ah)
So come and join me
And call me Harley
And we'll make 'em scream

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)
[Verse 1]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

I think I see your face in every place that I go
I try to hide it, but I know that it's gonna show
Every single night, I find it harder to sleep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
'Cause I need you here with me
[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, started off right
I can see it in your eyes
I can tell that you're wantin' more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

[Refrain]
Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?

I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock

[Refrain]
Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?

Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

With your plate, you just can't help it

You'll be saying, "No (No, no, no), no (No)"

Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me

Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me

Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Outro: Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
[Verse 1]
I'm here outside when you’re ready (When you're ready for me)
Bring out the shots and confetti (All night long)
I'll take you home if you let me, yeah (Oh yeah)
Just promise you won’t forget me, no

[Chorus]
'Cause the days get brighter when you're here
So I gotta keep you near
Goin' crazy and I just can't get you outta my head
Love is in the atmosphere, you can feel it in the air
Gettin' hazy and I just can't get you outta my head

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My head)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Just can't get you outta my head

[Verse 2]
You locked the door and it’s raining (Just let it rain down)
But baby, I’m not complaining, no
We hit the road and we're racin’ yeah
You make me super impatient (Oh)
Can you feel the tension? You've got my attention
I know we're just friends, but I'd rather be together instead, yeah

[Chorus]
’Cause the days get brighter when you're here
So I gotta keep you near (Oh-ah)
Goin' crazy and I just can't get you outta my head (Yeah)
Love is in the atmosphere, you can feel it in the air (Oh)
Gettin' hazy and I just can't get you outta my head

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My head)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Just can't get you outta my head

[Bridge]
Can't get you outta my head
My head, my head
My head, my head
My head, my head
My head, my head
Can't get you outta my head
My head, my head
My head, my head
Can't get you outta my

[Outro]
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My head)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah (My)
Ooh-woah, ooh-woah
Just can't get you outta my head
[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Hoo, huh, uh, huhh-ow
Huh, huhh-huhhh

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now
[Verse 1: BONN]
Summer nights all align
As we drown in the moonlight
We collide in plain sight
Yeah, I know we'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus: BONN]
And we come alive, we run the night with strangers
'Cause in the end, we're all familiar faces
We're young and wild, enjoy the ride, we made it
We made it

[Chorus: BONN]
I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
Say you'll never leave
Because I love the feeling, I love the feeling
Find myself awake at night
See you through my lucid eyes
Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

[Post-Chorus: BONN]
I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

[Verse 2: BONN]
Wide awake, no time to waste
Make a mark on my timeline
We're safe and sound, we come around
We are dancing, the sun down

[Pre-Chorus: BONN]
And we come alive, we run the night with strangers
'Cause in the end, we're all familiar faces
We're young and wild, enjoy the ride, we made it
We made it

[Chorus: BONN]
I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
Say you'll never leave
Because I love the feeling, I love the feeling
Find myself awake at night
See you through my lucid eyes
Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

[Post-Chorus: BONN]
Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

[Outro: BONN]
Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
[Intro]
DDA-DDA-LA-DDA-LA-DDA-LA
DDA-DDA-LA-DDA-LA-DDA-LA

[Verse 1]
There are days
I wake up and I pinch myself
You're with me, not someone else
And I'm scared, yeah, I'm still scared
That it's all a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you still look perfect as days go by
Even the worst ones, you make me smile
I'd stop the world if it gave us time

[Chorus]
'Cause when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do

[Verse 2]
When you say
You love the way I make you feel
Everything becomes so real
Don't be scared, no, don't be scared
'Cause you're all I need

[Pre-Chorus]
And you still look perfect as days go by
Even the worst ones, you make me smile
I'd stop the world if it gave us time

[Chorus]
'Cause when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do

[Bridge]
All my life
I thought it'd be hard to find
The one, 'til I found you
And I find it bittersweet
'Cause you gave me something to lose

[Chorus]
But when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do
[Verse 1: Emelie Hollow]
Lily was a little girl
Afraid of the big, wide world
She grew up within her castle walls
Now and then she tried to run
And then on the night with the setting sun
She went in the woods away
So afraid, all alone

[Pre-Chorus: Emelie Hollow]
They warned her, don’t go there
There's creatures who are hiding in the dark
Then something came creeping
It told her, don’t you worry just

[Chorus: Emelie Hollow]
Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you’ve been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you’ll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh

[Verse 2: Emelie Hollow]
She knew she was hypnotized
And walking on cold thin ice
Then it broke, and she awoke again

[Pre-Chorus: Emelie Hollow]
Then she ran faster and
Start screaming, is there someone out there?
Please help me
Come get me
Behind her, she can hear it say

[Chorus: Emelie Hollow]
Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you’ve been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you’ll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh

[Bridge: Emelie Hollow]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you’ve been told (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And you’ll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh

[Outro: Emelie Hollow]
Follow everywhere I go
Top over the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you’ve been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Then she ran faster and
Start screaming, is there someone out there?
Please help me
Just let me in, ooh
[Verse 1]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
Two times clean again, I'm actin' low
A pound of weed and a bag of blow

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Verse 2]
I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to bleed
I'd let go, but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how, but I need to now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
(We could be) We could be more than just part-time lovers
(Part-time lovers, yeah)
(More than, more than lovers)
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Outro]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
[Verse 1: Daniel Seavey]
Work all day, work all night
Might not get no sleep tonight
Baby, can you stay up?
We could talk, we could dance
Don't matter the circumstance
We don't let it change us

[Pre-Chorus: Corbyn Besson]
That's the beautiful thing about us
'Fore all the diamonds and rings, we got trust
Roll with me, get it right, faded on a summer night
Let's see where it takes us

[Chorus: Zach Herron & All]
I got real big plans, baby, for you and me
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be
Ain't got everything you want, but got everything you need
So take a chance, take a chance on me
I got real big plans, baby, for you and me
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be
Ain't got everything you want, but got everything you need
So take a chance, take a chance on me

[Post-Chorus: Zach Herron & Jack Avery]
I got real big plans
Hold up, hold up, baby
I got real big plans
Hold up, hold up, baby

[Verse 2: Jonah Marais]
Know you're tired, know you're down
Know you wanna leave this town
Baby, give me one year, yeah
Take my hand, take a leap
Girl, you gotta wait and see
Where I take it from here

[Pre-Chorus: Corbyn Besson, All]
That's the beautiful thing about you
I know that you'd do the same in my shoes
Never switch, never stop, I could see us at the top
Girl, why don't we go there?

[Chorus: Zach Herron & All]
I got real big plans, baby, for you and me
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be
Ain't got everything you want, but got everything you need
So take a chance, take a chance on me
I got real big plans, baby, for you and me
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be
Ain't got everything you want, but got everything you need
So take a chance, take a chance on me

[Post-Chorus: Zach Herron & Jack Avery, Daniel Seavey]
I got real big plans
Hold up, hold up, baby (Oh)
I got real big plans
Hold up, hold up, baby

[Bridge: Jonah Marais, Jack Avery, Daniel Seavey, Corbyn Besson]
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Take a chance on
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Just take a chance on
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Take a chance on
Take a chance on me

[Chorus: Zach Herron & Jack Avery, Daniel Seavey]
I got real big plans, baby, for you and me
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be
Ain't got everything you want, but got everything you need (Baby)
So take a chance, take a chance on me

[Post-Chorus: Zach Herron & Jack Avery, Corbyn Besson, Jonah Marais]
I got real big plans
Hold up, hold up, baby (Take a chance on me)
I got real big plans (Take a chance on me)
Hold up, hold up, baby

[Outro: Zach Herron]
I got real big plans
[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin'—

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, next
Thank you, next

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching

[Verse 1]
This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Verse 2]
Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Bridge]
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Verse 1]
I don't see you
You're not in every window I look through
And I don't miss you
You're not in every single thing I do
I don't think we're meant to be
And you are not the missing piece
I won't hear it
Whenever anybody says your name
And I won't feel it
Even when I'm burstin' into flames
I don't regret the day I left
I don't believe that I was blessed
I'm probably lyin' to myself, again

[Chorus]
I'm alone in my head
Looking for love in a stranger's bed
But I don't think I'll find it
'Cause only you could fill this empty space
I wanna tell all my friends
But I don't think they would understand
It's somethin' I've decided
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

[Post-Chorus]
Space, space
This empty space
Space, space
This—
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

[Verse 2]
I've been drinking
I've been doin' things I shouldn't do
Overthinking
I don't know who I am without you
I'm a liar and a cheat
I let my ego swallow me
And that's why I might never see you again

[Chorus]
I'm alone in my head
Looking for love in a stranger's bed
But I don't think I'll find it
'Cause only you could fill this empty space
I wanna tell all my friends
But I don't think they would understand
It's somethin' I've decided
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

[Post-Chorus]
Space, space
This empty space
Space, space
This—
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

[Outro]
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me? (Space, space)
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me? (Space, space)
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me? (Space, space)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
How could I make you love me?
[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Bridge]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Outro]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
[Verse 1]
"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say (Aww)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha)

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Verse 2]
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
(Yay)

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Bridge]
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
Even though we both know we're liars and we start each other's fires
We just know that we'll be alright
Even though we're kicked out the party 'cause we both hate everybody
We're the ones they wanna be like

[Pre-Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
So don't let me down
Keep me in trouble
Born to be wild
Out in the jungle

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding & Swae Lee]
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al
Like animal, like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me (Woo)

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
You can never come too close for comfort
I had to cut my bitch off, she bein' stubborn (Stubborn)
I make it known I fuck with you, not undercover ('Cover)
And when I jump in, I'm burnin' rubber (Yeah, skrrt)
Iced out body, didn't go to college (Yeah, yeah)
Price tag poppin', then you on a private (Then you on a)
Don't say "Sorry," everyone's watchin' (Everyone)
When you're where I am, everything's timeless (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding & Swae Lee]
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al
Like animal, like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me (Yee)
Close to me

[Break: Ellie Goulding & Swae Lee]
Close to me (Woo)
Yeah

[Bridge: Ellie Goulding]
Animal, animal-al
Like animal, like you

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding & Swae Lee]
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body (Yeah)
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me (Yeah, yeah)
Because I'm an animal, animal-al
Like animal, like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
Close to me

[Outro: Ellie Goulding]
(To me)
Close to me
[Verse 1]
You got me some type of way (Hmm)
Ain't used to feelin' this way (Mmm-mmm)
I do not know what to say (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one fuckin' look at your face (Hmm)
Now I wanna know how you taste (Mmm-mmm)
Usually don't give it away (Yeah, yeah)
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I realize she's right there

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Hands on your body, I'm grabbin' your ass
Enjoyin' the moment 'cause life move too fast
I'm lookin' forward, ignorin' the past
These are the times that we'll laugh lookin' back
I'm gettin' lucky like coins in the well
Goodbye to my haters, I'm wishin' you well
This is my year, man, if you couldn't tell

[Pre-Chorus]
This is our life and we livin' it well
Late nights in the city, causin' hell
Burn this bitch into the ground, oh well
If all we got tonight, let's do this right
Let's do this right

[Chorus]
Let's go to (Paradise)
This shit feel like Friday nights
This shit make me feel alive
I feel like we in paradise, paradise (Paradise)
Don't know if it's the drink I poured
But I swear I've never loved you more
When you right here, I come alive
One more hit and we can fly
This shit feel like (Paradise)

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' it, my head's where the ceilin' is (Oh yeah)
This energy turns nights into memories (Oh yeah)
Count up the bands, you've been workin' all summer
Ex didn't know what he had, what a bummer
Insecure people turn to insecure lovers
Well, my drink is almost out and I'm about to pour another

[Bridge]
Just let it out
The night has just begun, we on a level now
If I get too fucked up, promise you'll hold me down
Yeah, this that shit you can't deny
This that shit you feel inside

[Pre-Chorus]
This our life, our time, we livin' well
Late nights in the city, causin' hell
Burn this bitch into the ground, oh well
If all we got tonight, let's do this right
Let's do this right

[Chorus]
Let's go to (Paradise)
This shit feel like Friday nights (Ooh, it do)
This shit make me feel alive (Baby)
I feel like we in paradise, paradise (Paradise, oh yeah)
Don't know if it's the drink I poured (Poured)
But I swear I've never loved you more (Loved you more)
When you right here, I come alive
One more hit and we can fly
This shit feel like (Paradise)
