[Intro: Jennie, Lisa]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
BLACKPINK IN YOUR AREA!
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Jennie]
천사 같은 "hi" 끝엔 악마 같은 "bye"
매번 미칠듯한 high 뒤엔 뱉어야 하는 price
이건 답이 없는 test
매번 속더라도 yes
딱한 감정의 노예
얼어 죽을 사랑해, eh

[Verse 2: Lisa]
Here I come kickin' the door, uh
가장 독한 걸로 줘, uh
뻔하디 뻔한 그 love, love
더 내놔봐 give me some more
알아서 매달려 벼랑 끝에
한마디면 또 like 헤벌레 해
그 따뜻한 떨림이 새빨간 설렘이
마치 heaven 같겠지만
You might not get in it

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo & Rosé]
Look at me, look at you
누가 더 아플까
You smart 누가 you are
두 눈에 피눈물 흐르게 된다면
So sorry 누가 you are
나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어
애써 두 눈을 가린 채
사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어

[Chorus: All, Lisa, Jennie]
Let's kill this love!
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Let's kill this love!
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

[Verse 3: Jennie, Lisa]
Feelin' like a sinner
It's so fire with him I go boo, hoo
He said "you look crazy"
Thank you, baby
I owe it all to you
Got me all messed up
His love is my favorite
But you plus me
Sadly can be dangerous

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé & Jisoo]
Lucky me, lucky you
결국엔 거짓말 we lie
So what? So what?
만약에 내가 널 지우게
된다면 so sorry
I'm not sorry
나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어
애써 눈물을 감춘 채, eh
사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어

[Chorus: All, Lisa, Jennie]
Let's kill this love!
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Let's kill this love!
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

[Bridge: Rosé]
We all commit to love
That makes you cry, oh oh
We're all making love
That kills you inside, yeah

[Outro: All]
We must kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Before it kills you too
Kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Gotta kill, let's kill this love!
[Verse 1: Jennie]
잠깐 누가 시간을 좀 멈춰봐
뭔가 크게 어긋난 걸 난 느껴

[Verse 2: Lisa]
애써 어색하게 웃어보다
이젠 그런 내가 안쓰러워

[Pre-Chorus 1: Rosé]
아냐 괜찮다고 말하지만
Don’t know what to do without you
하찮은 이곳에 홀로 남아
그려본 네 기억은 blue

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jisoo]
사람은 변해 왜 나만 이래
오늘처럼 예쁜 날에
어떻게 이렇게 모든 게 벅차기만 해
Don’t know what to do

[Chorus: Rosé, Jisoo & Lisa]
I don’t know what to do without you
Yeah, hey, hey
I don’t know what to do without you
Yeah, hey, hey
I don’t know what to do without you, uh, uh, uh
You, uh, uh, uh
You, uh, uh, uh
You know, I don’t know what to do
Don’t know what to do

[Verse 3: Jisoo]
잠깐 왔다 떠난 사람들처럼
그냥 우린 아니었던 거지 뭐

[Verse 4: Jennie & Lisa]
혹시라도 전화가 울릴까 봐
괜한 기댈 하는 내가 미워
자꾸 똑딱 거리는 시계 소리가
유난히 거슬려

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jennie]
꽤나 멀쩡해 보이지만
Don’t know what to do without you
이런 내 맘 거울에 들킬까 봐
그려본 내 입술은 blue

[Pre-Chorus 2: Rosé & Jennie]
혼자가 편해 난 그냥 그래
오늘처럼 예쁜 날에
어떻게 이렇게 모든 게 벅차기만 해
Don’t know what to do

[Chorus: Jennie, Jisoo & Lisa]
I don’t know what to do without you
Yeah, hey, hey
I don’t know what to do without you
Yeah, hey, hey
I don’t know what to do without you, uh, uh, uh
You, uh, uh, uh
You, uh, uh, uh
You know, I don’t know what to do
Don’t know what to do without you

[Outro: Rosé]
아냐 괜찮다고 말하지만
Don’t know what to do without you
하찮은 이곳에 홀로 남아
그려본 네 기억은 blue
[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad
[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
We go together
Better than birds of a feather, you and me
We change the weather, yeah
I'm feelin' heat in December when you're 'round me

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I'm a sucker for you
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (About you), about you (About you)
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you, yeah

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Don't complicate it (Yeah)
'Cause I know you and you know everything about me
I can't remember (Yeah) all of the nights
I don't remember when you're 'round me (Oh, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I'm a sucker for you

Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (About you), about you (About you)
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you, yeah (Uh)

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
(I'm a sucker for you)
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly

[Verse 1: Sabrina Carpenter]
I'm sorry but, don't wanna talk
I need a moment 'fore I go
It's nothin' personal
I draw the blinds, they don't need to see me cry
'Cause even if they understand, they don't understand

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
So then, when I'm finished
I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
I'm takin' my misery, make it my bitch
Can't be everyone's favourite girl

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way

[Verse 2: Farruko]
(Ya, ya)
(Farru, yeah, guaya)
Lo siento mucho (Farru), pero me voy (Eh)
Porque a tu lado me di cuenta que nada soy (Eh-ey)
Y me cansé de luchar y de guerrear en vano
De estar en la línea de fuego y de meter la mano
Acepto mis errore', también soy humano
Y tú no ve' que lo hago porque te amo (Pum-pum-pum-pum)

[Pre-Chorus: Farruko]
Pero ya (Ya) no tengo más na' que hacer aquí (Aquí)
Me voy, llegó la hora 'e partir (Partir)
De mi propio camino, seguir lejos de ti

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter & Farruko]
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise (Is on the rise, na-na)
The fire burning in my eyes (The fire burning in my eyes, no)
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way, uh

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Sabrina Carpenter & Farruko]
I'm on my way
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody on my way

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
[Verse 1: V]
내가 날 눈치챘던 순간
떠나야만 했어
난 찾아내야 했어
All day all night

[Verse 2: Jimin]
사막과 바다들을 건너
넓고 넓은 세계를
헤매어 다녔어
Baby I

[Refrain: Jungkook]
I could make it better
I could hold you tighter
그 먼 길 위에서
Oh you’re the light

[Verse 4: V]
초대받지 못한
환영받지 못한
나를 알아줬던 단 한 사람

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
끝도 보이지 않던 영원의 밤
내게 아침을 선물한 건 너야
이제 그 손 내가 잡아도 될까
Oh oh
I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Verse 5: J-Hope]
이 세상 속에 영웅이 된 나
나를 찾는 큰 환호와
내 손, 트로피와 금빛 마이크
All day, everywhere
But 모든 게 너에게 닿기 위함인 걸
내 여정의 답인 걸
널 찾기 위해 노래해
Baby to you

[Verse 6: RM]
전보다 조금 더 커진 키에
좀 더 단단해진 목소리에
모든 건 네게 돌아가기 위해
이제 너라는 지도를 활짝 펼칠게
My rehab
날 봐 왜 못 알아봐
남들의 아우성 따위 나 듣고 싶지 않아
너의 향기는 여전히 나를 꿰뚫어 무너뜨려
되돌아가자 그때로

[Refrain: Jin]
Baby I know
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
그 모든 길은 널
향한 거야

[Verse 7: Jimin]
다 소용없었어
너 아닌 다른 건
그때처럼 날 어루만져줘

[Pre-Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin]
끝도 보이지 않던 영원의 밤
내게 아침을 선물한 건 너야
이제 그 손 내가 잡아도 될까
Oh oh
I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, V]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right

[Bridge: Suga]
여전히 아름다운 너
그날의 그때처럼 말없이 그냥 날 안아줘
지옥에서 내가 살아 남은 건
날 위했던 게 아닌 되려 너를 위한 거란 걸
안다면 주저 말고 please save my life
너 없이 헤쳐왔던 사막 위는 목말라
그러니 어서 빨리 날 잡아줘
너 없는 바다는 결국 사막과 같을 거란 걸 알아

[Refrain: Jimin, Jungkook]
All right
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
Oh I can make it right

[Outro: V, Jimin]
다 소용없었어
너 아닌 다른 건
Oh I can make it right

[Jungkook, Jimin, V]
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right
[Intro: RM]
I'm exhausted man
Oh, guess what?
I just want to go home

[Verse 1: Jimin, RM]
미칠듯한 설레임에
인사조차 못했어 (yeah, right)
Yeah I’m going out baby
온 세상이 내 집

[Verse 2: V, RM]
Crazy for myself (yeah)
저 문을 열면 뭐든 다 될 것처럼 (right)
마치 무슨 본때를 보여줄 것처럼 (uh huh)
집을 나섰지
(이 모든 상상이 다 신기루로 끝나지 않길)

[Verse 3: RM]
Oh yeah I did it, me shine with flashin' lights
Got lotta friends, 고즈넉한 내 공간
그래 기억해 뭐든 다 할 수 있을 것만 같던 때
I saw the ocean yeah 이 문을 열기도 전에
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, Jin]
뭔가 채울수록 더 비어가
함께일수록 더 혼자인 것 같아
반쯤 감긴 눈, 잠 못 드는 밤
니가 있는 곳

[Chorus: V, Jin, RM]
아마 그곳이 Mi Casa
With you I'mma feel rich
바로 그곳이 Mi Casa
미리 켜둬 너의 switch
Yeah

[Post-Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook, V, RM]
말을 안 해도 편안할 거야
너만 있다면 다 내 집이 될 거야
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that
Home

[Refrain: Jimin, Jungkook]
Your love your love your love (I miss that)
Your love your love your love (I want that)
Your touch your touch your touch (I need that)
La la la la la la la la I love it

[Verse 4: J-Hope]
불 꺼진 현관에 내 발이 이상해
눈 감고 이불 안에 있어도 이상해
둥 붕 뜬 기분 빙 도는 두 눈
이 멋진 공간에 나 완전 초라해

[Verse 5: Suga]
완전 초라해
세상은 우리가 세상을 다 가진 줄 아는군
꿈에 그리던 Big house, big cars, big rings
내가 원한 건 모든 걸 가져도
뭔가 허전한 지금 모든 걸 이룬 자가 느낀 낯선 기분
But 지금 떠나도 돌아올 곳이 있기에 나서는 문

[Bridge: Jin]
갈림길에서 자꾸 생각나
볼품없던 날 알아줬던 너
니 생각에 웃을 수 있었어
니가 있는 곳

[Chorus: Jimin, V]
아마 그곳이 Mi Casa
With you I’mma feel rich
바로 그곳이 Mi Casa
미리 켜둬 너의 switch
Yeah

[Post-Chorus: Jimin, V]
말을 안 해도 편안할 거야
너만 있다면 다 내 집이 될 거야
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that
Home

[Verse 6: Jimin, Jungkook, Jin]
그 언젠가
초인종이 세 번 울리면
문을 열어주겠니
미처 못한 인사를 전할 수 있게
그땐 말할게

[Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
오랜만이야 Mi Casa
With you I just feel rich
다녀왔어 Hi Mi Casa
켜뒀구나 너의 switch
Yeah

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin]
말을 안 해도 편안하잖아
니가 있어서 나의 집이 된 거야
You know I want that
Home
You know you got that
Home

[Refrain: Jungkook, V, Jimin]
Your love your love your love (I miss that)
Your love your love your love (I want that)
Your touch your touch your touch (I need that)
La la la la la la la la I love it
[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got a juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)
[Verse 1: Jin]
또 져버린 것 같아
넌 화가 나 보여
아른대는 Game over over over

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
만약 게임이라면
또 load하면 되겠지만
I guess I gotta deal with this, deal with this
Real world

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
차라리 게임이면 좋겠지
너무 아프니까
I need to heal my medic
But I’m another star
완벽하지 못했던 나를 탓해
Brake in my head, brake in my step, always
그저 잘하고 싶었고
웃게 해주고 싶었는데.. damn

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
Please give me a remedy
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
이제 어떻게 해야 해
날 살려줘 다시 기회를 줘
Please give me

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
A remedy, a melody
오직 내게만 남겨질 그 memory
이쯤에서 그만하면
꺼버리면 모든 게 다 편해질까

[Verse 4: Jin]
괜찮지만 괜찮지 않아
익숙하다고 혼잣말했지만
늘 처음인 것처럼 아파

[Verse 5: J-Hope]
부족한 gamer, 맞아 날 control 못하지
계속 아파 ‘Cause 시행착오와 오만 가지
내 노래 가사, 몸짓 하나
말 한마디 다 내 미시감에 무서워지고
또 늘 도망가려 해
But 잡네, 그래도 네가
내 그림자는 커져가도 내 삶과 넌 equal sign
So 내 remedy는 your remedy

[Chorus: Jin, Jungkook]
Please give me a remedy
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
이제 어떻게 해야 해
날 살려줘 다시 기회를 줘
Please give me a

[Bridge: Jin, Jungkook]
(Remedy)
또 다시 뛰고, 또 넘어지고
(Honestly)
수없이 반복된대도
난 또 뛸 거라고

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin]
So give me a remedy
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
이제 어떻게 해야 해
날 살려줘 다시 기회를 줘

[Outro: Jungkook, Jin, J-Hope]
Please give me a remedy
(성공인가. 돌아왔어)
멈춰버린 심장을 뛰게 할 remedy
(집중해서 꼭 네게 닿고 말겠어. 떨어지고, 넘어지고)
이제 어떻게 해야 해
(익숙한 아픔이 똑같이 날 덮쳐)
날 살려줘
(이번에도 쉽지 않아)
다시 기회를 줘
(관둘 거냐고? No, no never)
I won’t give up
[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa

[Verse 1: Lauv]
Party, trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me is falling in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it, taking a shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think that they make anything that strong, so I hold on
I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers
And when they leave, I go back to our song, I hold on
I, I, oh I
Hurts like heaven, lost in the sound
Buzz cut season like you're still around
Can't unmiss you and I need you now
Yeah, I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv & Troye Sivan]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
I'm so tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love songs (Someone take me home)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home ('Cause I can't be alone)
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs ('Cause I'm so tired)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
[Intro: Sam Smith]
Hmm, mhm

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
I don't wanna be alone tonight (Alone tonight)
It's pretty clear that I'm not over you (Over you, over you)
I'm still thinking 'bout the things you do (Things you do)
So I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight
Can you light the fire? (Light the fire, light the fire)
I need somebody who can take control (Take control)
I know exactly what I need to do

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new

[Chorus: Conor Maynard]
Remember when I told you
"No matter where I go
I'll never leave your side
You will never be alone"
Even when we go through changes
Even when we're old
Remember that I told you
I'll find my way back home

[Verse 1: Conor Maynard]
I could never let you go
Couldn't run away if I tried
'Cause even when I'm all alone
You still got a hold on my mind
And I'll always let you know
That I'm always gonna hold on

[Pre-Chorus: Conor Maynard]
And I told you right from the start
You just say the word and I'll go
No, it doesn't matter how far
'Cause your love is all that I know
Baby, you just stay where you are
And you know I won't be too long
Hold on
Hold on

[Chorus: Conor Maynard]
Remember when I told you
"No matter where I go
I'll never leave your side
You will never be alone"
Even when we go through changes
Even when we're old
Remember that I told you
I'll find my way back home

[Verse 2: SHAUN]
조용히 잠든 방을 열어 기억을 꺼내 들어
부서진 시간 위에서 선명히 너는 떠올라
길 잃은 마음속에 널 가둔 채 살아
그만 그만

[Chorus: SHAUN]
멈춘 시간 속 잠든 너를 찾아가
아무리 막아도 결국 너의 곁인 걸
길고 긴 여행을 끝내 이젠 돌아가
너라는 집으로 지금 다시 way back home

[Bridge: SHAUN & Conor Maynard]
세상을 뒤집어 찾으려 해
오직 너로 완결된 이야기를
No, I won't ever lose
As long as you're there

[Chorus: SHAUN & Conor Maynard]
눈을 감으면 소리 없이 밀려와
이 마음 그 위로 넌 또 한 겹 쌓여가
Even when we go through changes
Even when we're old
Remember that I told you
I'll find my way back home
[Intro: J-Hope, V]
쭉 들이켜
술잔 (sippin’) 팔짱 (tippin’)
한 입
티르소스 (grippin’) 포도 (eatin’)
쭉 들이켜
분위기 (keep it) D style (rip it)
한 입
여기 (kill it) let’s steal it
The illest

[Verse 1: RM]
그냥 취해 마치 디오니소스
한 손에 술잔, 다른 손에 든 티르소스
투명한 크리스탈 잔 속 찰랑이는 예술
예술도 술이지 뭐, 마시면 취해 fool
You dunno you dunno
You dunno what to do with
내가 보여줄게 난 전혀 다른 걸 추진
아이비와 거친 나무로 된 mic
절대 단 한 숨에
나오는 소리 따윈 없다

[Refrain: Jimin, J-Hope, Jungkook]
해가 뜰 때까지 where the party at
잠이 들 때까지 where the party at
Sing it 불러 다시
Drink it 마셔 다시
우린 두 번 태어나지

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, J-Hope]
쭉 들이켜 (창작의 고통)
한 입 (시대의 호통)
쭉 들이켜 (나와의 소통)
한 입 (Okay now I’m ready fo sho)

[Chorus: V, Jimin, J-Hope]
다 마셔 마셔 마셔 마셔 내 술잔 ay

예술에 취해 불러 옹헤야

[Chorus: Jimin, J-Hope, Jungkook]

티르소스 (grippin’), 포도 (eatin’)
분위기 (keep it), D style (rip it)
여기 (kill it) let’s steal it
The illest

[Verse 2: V, Jungkook]
난 지금 세상의 문 앞에 있어
무대에 오를 때 들리는 환호성
Can't you see my stacked
Broken thyrsus
이제 난 다시 태어나네 비로소

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
When the night comes
Mumble mumble mumble
When the night comes
Tumble tumble tumble
Studio를 채운 저음 저음 저음
Bass drum goes like 덤덤덤 (yea)

Kpop 아이돌로 태어나
다시 환생한 artist

내가 아이돌이든 예술가이든
뭐가 중요해 짠해
예술도 이 정도면 과음이지 과음 yeah
새 기록은 자신과 싸움이지 싸움 yeah
축배를 들어올리고 one shot
허나 난 여전히 목말라

[Break: RM]
You ready for this?
Are you ready to get hyped up?
Come on

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the whispers all across the room?
You feel her eyes all over you like cheap perfume
You're beautiful, but misunderstood
So why you tryna be just like the neighborhood?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see ya, I know what you're feelin'
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret
I'm a little crazy underneath this
Underneath this

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Verse 2]
Oh so, dress up fancy like Sid and Nancy (Yeah)
Walkin' Killer Queen, gotta keep 'em guessin'
So baby come pass me a lighter
We're gonna leave 'em on fire
We're the sinners and the blessings

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see ya, I know what you're feelin'
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret
I'm a little crazy underneath this
Underneath this, ooh

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Bridge]
(Ah-ah-ah)
You're king and you're queen
You're strong then you're weak
You're bound but so free
(Ah-ah-ah)
So come and join me
And call me Harley
And we'll make 'em scream

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)
[Verse 1]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Verse 2]
I think I see your face in every place that I go
I try to hide it, but I know that it's gonna show
Every single night, I find it harder to sleep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Outro]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
'Cause I need you here with me
[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, started off right
I can see it in your eyes
I can tell that you're wantin' more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

[Refrain]
Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts (Yeah)
Can't get what we want without knowin' (No)
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 2]
Oh, nah
Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room
I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock

[Refrain]
Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Outro]
Figure out where we're goin'
[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 1]
She'll make you curse, but she a blessing
She'll rip your shirt within a second
You'll be coming back, back for seconds
With your plate, you just can't help it

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying, "No, no"
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 2]
See, someone said, "Don't drink her potions
She'll kiss your neck with no emotion
When she's mean, you know you love it
She tastes so sweet, don't sugarcoat it"

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying, "No (No, no, no), no (No)"
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Bridge]
You're just like me, you're out your mind
I know it's strange, we're both the crazy kind
You're tellin' me that I'm insane
Boy, don't pretend that you don't love the pain

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 1: Jennie]
결론이 뭔데 또 그래서
어쩌겠다는 건데 I’ll break your, break your heart
Never asked for much
애써 노력 따윈 마, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Lisa]
쉽게 뱉은 말 주워 담지마
I ain’t nothin' like the same, same girls that you’ve had
그래 난 멋대로 해

[Pre-Chorus 1: Rosé & Jisoo]
어두운 밤이 날 감싸지만
이제서야 나를 위해서 춤을 출 수 있어
너란 벽을 넘어서
I’ll kick it if you’re down, kick it if you down

[Chorus: Jennie & Lisa]
Can I kick it? (Yeah!)
캄캄한 저 하늘 위에
한바탕 난리를 치며 불을 지를 거야
Can I kick it? (Yeah!)
너라는 세상을 부숴버리고
나 환하게 눈부셔 버릴 거야

[Post-Chorus: Rosé & Jisoo]
And I’m letting it all out
잃을 건 없잖아
이젠 나를 찾을 거라고
나 혼자여도 괜찮아
불쌍해하지 마
이젠 너를 잊을 거라고

[Verse 3: Lisa]
Never needed nothin’ else
Just a lil' love from myself
When you couldn’t be the one to help
Had to kick it and I did it
Tell whoever you wanna tell
Get kicked to the curb, ya kicked out
Never kick a girl when she kicked down
Who you gon' kiss now?
Know you gon' miss how I move
From the top to the bottom of my kicks now

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo & Rosé]
어두운 밤이 날 감싸지만
이제서야 나를 위해서 춤을 출 수 있어
너란 벽을 넘어서
I’ll kick it if you’re down, kick it if you down

[Chorus: Jennie & Lisa]
Can I kick it? (Yeah!)
캄캄한 저 하늘 위에
한바탕 난리를 치며 불을 지를 거야
Can I kick it? (Yeah!)
너라는 세상을 부숴버리고
나 환하게 눈부셔 버릴 거야

[Post-Chorus: Rosé & Jisoo]
And I’m letting it all out
잃을 건 없잖아
이젠 나를 찾을 거라고
나 혼자여도 괜찮아
불쌍해하지 마
이젠 너를 잊을 거라고

[Bridge: Jennie]
결론이 뭔데 또 그래서
어쩌겠다는 건데
답답한 너의 세상에서 벗어나
높이 날아갈 테니까

[Outro]
I’ll kick it how I wanna kick it
When I wanna kick it
No, you can’t tell me not to kick it
'Cause I’m 'bout to kick it
I’ll kick it how I wanna kick it
When I wanna kick it
No, you can’t tell me not to kick it
'Cause I’m 'bout to kick it

[Outro 2: Rosé & Jisoo]
And I’m letting it all out
잃을 건 없잖아
이젠 나를 찾을 거라고
나 혼자여도 괜찮아
불쌍해하지 마
이젠 너를 잊을 거라고
[Verse 1]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

[Pre-Chorus]
Said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

[Bridge]
You don't have to say just what you did (What you did)
I already know (I know)
I had to go and find out from them (Oh-woah)
So tell me, how's it feel? (Oh-woah)

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
[Intro: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh

[Refrain: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 2: Lil Nas X]
Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Verse 3: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Outro: Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Hoo, huh, uh, huhh-ow
Huh, huhh-huhhh

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now
[Verse 1: BONN]
Summer nights all align
As we drown in the moonlight
We collide in plain sight
Yeah, I know we'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus: BONN]
And we come alive, we run the night with strangers
'Cause in the end, we're all familiar faces
We're young and wild, enjoy the ride, we made it
We made it

[Chorus: BONN]
I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
Say you'll never leave
Because I love the feeling, I love the feeling
Find myself awake at night
See you through my lucid eyes
Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

[Post-Chorus: BONN]
I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

[Verse 2: BONN]
Wide awake, no time to waste
Make a mark on my timeline
We're safe and sound, we come around
We are dancing, the sun down

[Pre-Chorus: BONN]
And we come alive, we run the night with strangers
'Cause in the end, we're all familiar faces
We're young and wild, enjoy the ride, we made it
We made it

[Chorus: BONN]
I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
Say you'll never leave
Because I love the feeling, I love the feeling
Find myself awake at night
See you through my lucid eyes
Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

[Post-Chorus: BONN]
Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

[Outro: BONN]
Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

[Verse 1: Ryujin & Yeji]
People look at me, and they tell me
외모만 보고 내가 날라리 같대요 (no, no)
So what? 신경 안 써
I'm sorry I don't care, don't care, really don't care (be-be-be-because)

[Verse 2: Chaeryeong & Yuna]
사랑 따외에 목매지 않아
세상엔 재밌는 게 더 많아
언니들이 말해 철들려면 멀었대
(I'm sorry, sorry) 철들 생각 없어요

[Chorus: Yeji & Lia]
예쁘기만 하고 매력은 없는
애들과 난 달라 달라 달라
DDA-DDA-LA DDA-LA DDA-LA
네 기준에 날 맞추려 하지 마
난 지금 내가 좋아 나는 나야

[Verse 3: Yuna, Chaeryeong, Yeji]
Bad, bad, I'm sorry I'm bad
I'm just the way I am
남 신경 쓰고 살긴 아까워
하고 싶은 일 하기도 바빠
My life, 내 맘대로 살 거야 말리지 마
난 특별하니까 yeah

[Verse 4: Chaeryeong & Yuna]
남들의 시선 중요치 않아
내 style이 좋아 그게 나니까
언니들이 말해 내가 너무 당돌하대
(I'm sorry, sorry) 바꿀 생각 없어요

[Chorus: Yeji & Lia]
예쁘기만 하고 매력은 없는
애들과 난 달라 달라 달라
DDA-DDA-LA DDA-LA DDA-LA

Don't care what people say 나는 내가 알아
I'm talkin' to myself 기죽지 마 절대로
고개를 들고 네 꿈을 쫓아
Just keep on dreamin', whoa!

[Verse 1]
There are days
I wake up and I pinch myself
You're with me, not someone else
And I'm scared, yeah, I'm still scared
That it's all a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you still look perfect as days go by
Even the worst ones, you make me smile
I'd stop the world if it gave us time

[Chorus]
'Cause when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do

[Verse 2]
When you say
You love the way I make you feel
Everything becomes so real
Don't be scared, no, don't be scared
'Cause you're all I need

[Pre-Chorus]
And you still look perfect as days go by
Even the worst ones, you make me smile
I'd stop the world if it gave us time

[Chorus]
'Cause when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do

[Bridge]
All my life
I thought it'd be hard to find
The one, 'til I found you
And I find it bittersweet
'Cause you gave me something to lose

[Chorus]
But when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do
[Verse 1: Emelie Hollow]
Lily was a little girl
Afraid of the big, wide world
She grew up within her castle walls
Now and then she tried to run
And then on the night with the setting sun
She went in the woods away
So afraid, all alone

[Pre-Chorus: Emelie Hollow]
They warned her, don’t go there
There's creatures who are hiding in the dark
Then something came creeping
It told her, don’t you worry just

[Chorus: Emelie Hollow]
Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you’ve been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you’ll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh

[Verse 2: Emelie Hollow]
She knew she was hypnotized
And walking on cold thin ice
Then it broke, and she awoke again

[Pre-Chorus: Emelie Hollow]
Then she ran faster and
Start screaming, is there someone out there?
Please help me
Come get me
Behind her, she can hear it say

[Chorus: Emelie Hollow]
Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you’ve been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you’ll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh

[Bridge: Emelie Hollow]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you’ve been told (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And you’ll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh

[Outro: Emelie Hollow]
Follow everywhere I go
Top over the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you’ve been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Then she ran faster and
Start screaming, is there someone out there?
Please help me
Just let me in, ooh
[Verse 1]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
Two times clean again, I'm actin' low
A pound of weed and a bag of blow

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Verse 2]
I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to bleed
I'd let go, but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how, but I need to now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
(We could be) We could be more than just part-time lovers
(Part-time lovers, yeah)
(More than, more than lovers)
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Outro]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
[Verse 1: Daniel Seavey]
Work all day, work all night
Might not get no sleep tonight
Baby, can you stay up?
We could talk, we could dance
Don't matter the circumstance
We don't let it change us

[Pre-Chorus: Corbyn Besson]
That's the beautiful thing about us
'Fore all the diamonds and rings, we got trust
Roll with me, get it right, faded on a summer night
Let's see where it takes us

[Chorus: Zach Herron & All]
I got real big plans, baby, for you and me
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be
Ain't got everything you want, but got everything you need
So take a chance, take a chance on me
I got real big plans, baby, for you and me
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be
Ain't got everything you want, but got everything you need
So take a chance, take a chance on me

[Post-Chorus: Zach Herron & Jack Avery]
I got real big plans
Hold up, hold up, baby
I got real big plans
Hold up, hold up, baby

[Verse 2: Jonah Marais]
Know you're tired, know you're down
Know you wanna leave this town
Baby, give me one year, yeah
Take my hand, take a leap
Girl, you gotta wait and see
Where I take it from here

[Pre-Chorus: Corbyn Besson, All]
That's the beautiful thing about you
I know that you'd do the same in my shoes
Never switch, never stop, I could see us at the top
Girl, why don't we go there?

[Chorus: Zach Herron & All]
I got real big plans, baby, for you and me
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be
Ain't got everything you want, but got everything you need
So take a chance, take a chance on me
I got real big plans, baby, for you and me
So love me for who I am and for who I'm gonna be
Ain't got everything you want, but got everything you need
So take a chance, take a chance on me

[Post-Chorus: Zach Herron & Jack Avery, Daniel Seavey]
I got real big plans
Hold up, hold up, baby (Oh)

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Just take a chance on
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Take a chance on
Take a chance on me

[Chorus: Zach Herron & Jack Avery, Daniel Seavey]

I got real big plans
Hold up, hold up, baby (Take a chance on me)
I got real big plans (Take a chance on me)
Hold up, hold up, baby

[Outro: Zach Herron]
I got real big plans
[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, next

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

[Verse 1]
This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Verse 2]
Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Bridge]
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
[Verse 1]
천진난만 청순가련
새침한 척 이젠 지쳐 나
귀찮아
매일 뭐 해 어디야 밥은 잘 자
Baby 자기 여보 보고 싶어
다 부질없어

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me like (oh, oh, oh)
이건 아무 감동 없는
Love story (oh, oh, oh)
어떤 설렘도 어떤 의미도 (oh, oh, oh)
네겐 미안하지만
I’m not sorry (oh, oh, oh)
오늘부터 난 난 난

[Chorus]
빛이 나는 솔로
빛이 나는 솔로
I’m goin' solo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
I’m goin' solo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo

[Verse 2]
Used to be your girl
Now I’m used to being the GOAT
You’re sittin’ on your feelings
I’m sittin’ on my throne
I ain’t got no time for the troubles in your eyes
This time I’m only lookin’ at me, myself and I
(I’m goin' solo) I’mma do it on my own now
Now that you’re alone, got you lookin’ for a clone now
(So low) That’s how I’m gettin’ down
Destined for this and the crown

[Pre-Chorus]
Sing it loud like (oh, oh, oh)
이건 아무 감동 없는
Love story (oh, oh, oh)
어떤 설렘도 어떤 의미도  (oh, oh, oh)
네겐 미안하지만
I’m not sorry (oh, oh, oh)
오늘부터 난 난 난

[Chorus]
빛이 나는 솔로
빛이 나는 솔로
I’m goin' solo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
I’m goin' solo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo

[Bridge]
만남 설렘 감동 뒤엔
이별 눈물 후회 그리움
홀로인 게 좋아 난 나다워야 하니까
자유로운 바람처럼
구름 위에 별들처럼
멀리 가고 싶어 밝게 빛나고 싶어

[Outro]
Now I'm goin' slow-mo
빛이 나는 솔로
I’m goin' solo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
I’m goin' solo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
[Intro: All, Rosé]
BLACKPINK!
Ah yeah, ah yeah!
BLACKPINK!
Ah yeah, ah yeah!

[Verse 1: Jennie]
착한 얼굴에 그렇지 못한 태도
가녀린 몸매 속 가려진 volume은 두 배로
거침없이 직진 굳이 보진 않지 눈치
Black 하면 Pink 우린 예쁘장한 Savage

[Verse 2: Lisa]
원할 땐 대놓고 뺏지
넌 뭘 해도 칼로 물 베기
두 손엔 가득한 fat check
궁금하면 해봐 fact check
눈 높인 꼭대기
물 만난 물고기
좀 독해 난 Toxic
You 혹해 I'm Foxy

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé & Jisoo]
두 번 생각해
흔한 남들처럼 착한 척은 못 하니까
착각하지 마
쉽게 웃어주는 건 날 위한 거야
아직은 잘 모르겠지
굳이 원하면 test me
넌 불 보듯이 뻔해
만만한 걸 원했다면

[Chorus: Jennie]
Oh wait til’ I do what I (do)
Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du (Ah yeah, ay yeah!)
Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du (Ah yeah, ay yeah!)

[Verse 3: Jennie]
BLACKPINK
지금 내가 걸어가는 거린
BLACKPINK 4 way 사거리
동서남북 사방으로 run it
너네 버킷리스트 싹 다 I bought it
널 당기는 것도 멀리 밀치는 것도
제멋대로 하는 bad girl
좋건 싫어하건 누가 뭐라 하던
When the bass drop, it’s another banger

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo & Rosé]
두 번 생각해
흔한 남들처럼 착한 척은 못 하니까
착각하지 마
쉽게 웃어주는 건 날 위한 거야
아직은 잘 모르겠지
굳이 원하면 test me
넌 불 보듯이 뻔해
만만한 걸 원했다면

[Chorus: Jennie & Lisa]
Oh wait til’ I do what I (do)
Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du (Ah yeah, ay yeah!)
Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du (Ah yeah, ay yeah!)

[Bridge: Rosé & Lisa]
What you gonna do when I
Come come through with that that uh uh huh
What you gonna do when I
Come come through with that that uh uh huh
뜨거워 뜨거워 뜨거워 like fire
뜨거워 뜨거워 뜨거워 like fire

[Drop: All, Jisoo & Rosé]
BLACKPINK! Hey!
Ah yeah, ay yeah! Ah yeah, ay yeah!
뜨거워 뜨거워 뜨거워 like fire
뜨거워 뜨거워 뜨거워 like fire

[Outro: Jennie]
Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du
[Verse 1]
I don't see you
You're not in every window I look through
And I don't miss you
You're not in every single thing I do
I don't think we're meant to be
And you are not the missing piece
I won't hear it
Whenever anybody says your name
And I won't feel it
Even when I'm burstin' into flames
I don't regret the day I left
I don't believe that I was blessed
I'm probably lyin' to myself, again

[Chorus]
I'm alone in my head
Looking for love in a stranger's bed
But I don't think I'll find it
'Cause only you could fill this empty space
I wanna tell all my friends
But I don't think they would understand
It's somethin' I've decided
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

[Post-Chorus]
Space, space
This empty space
Space, space
This—
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

[Verse 2]
I've been drinking
I've been doin' things I shouldn't do
Overthinking
I don't know who I am without you
I'm a liar and a cheat
I let my ego swallow me
And that's why I might never see you again

[Chorus]
I'm alone in my head
Looking for love in a stranger's bed
But I don't think I'll find it
'Cause only you could fill this empty space
I wanna tell all my friends
But I don't think they would understand
It's somethin' I've decided
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

[Post-Chorus]
Space, space
This empty space
Space, space
This—
'Cause only you could fill this empty space

[Outro]
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me? (Space, space)
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me? (Space, space)
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me?
How could I make you love me? (Space, space)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
How could I make you love me?
[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Bridge]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Outro]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
[Verse 1]
"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say (Aww)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha)

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Verse 2]
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
(Yay)

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Bridge]
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay

Took one fuckin' look at your face (Hmm)
Now I wanna know how you taste (Mmm-mmm)
Usually don't give it away (Yeah, yeah)
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (Mornin')
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours

You're singin' my songs in the streets, yeah, yeah
Actin' all innocent, please
When I know you out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you realize she's right there (Yeah)
And you're at home like, "Damn, she can't compare"

[Bridge]
You could say I'm hatin' if you want to
But I only hate on her 'cause I want you
Say I'm trippin' if you feel like
But you without me ain't right (Ain't right)
You could call me crazy 'cause I want you
And I never even ever fuckin' met you
Say I'm trippin' and it ain't right
But you without me ain't nice (Ain't nice, yeah)

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You could hit it in the mornin' (Hit in the mornin', yeah, yeah, yeah)

Empezamo' a pie y ahora andamo' en el je' (Wuh)

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Hands on your body, I'm grabbin' your ass
Enjoyin' the moment 'cause life move too fast
I'm lookin' forward, ignorin' the past
These are the times that we'll laugh lookin' back
I'm gettin' lucky like coins in the well
Goodbye to my haters, I'm wishin' you well
This is my year, man, if you couldn't tell

[Pre-Chorus]
This is our life and we livin' it well
Late nights in the city, causin' hell
Burn this bitch into the ground, oh well
If all we got tonight, let's do this right
Let's do this right

[Chorus]
Let's go to (Paradise)
This shit feel like Friday nights
This shit make me feel alive
I feel like we in paradise, paradise (Paradise)
Don't know if it's the drink I poured
But I swear I've never loved you more
When you right here, I come alive
One more hit and we can fly
This shit feel like (Paradise)

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' it, my head's where the ceilin' is (Oh yeah)
This energy turns nights into memories (Oh yeah)
Count up the bands, you've been workin' all summer
Ex didn't know what he had, what a bummer
Insecure people turn to insecure lovers
Well, my drink is almost out and I'm about to pour another

[Bridge]
Just let it out
The night has just begun, we on a level now
If I get too fucked up, promise you'll hold me down
Yeah, this that shit you can't deny
This that shit you feel inside

[Pre-Chorus]
This our life, our time, we livin' well
Late nights in the city, causin' hell
Burn this bitch into the ground, oh well
If all we got tonight, let's do this right
Let's do this right

[Chorus]
Let's go to (Paradise)
This shit feel like Friday nights (Ooh, it do)
This shit make me feel alive (Baby)
I feel like we in paradise, paradise (Paradise, oh yeah)
Don't know if it's the drink I poured (Poured)
But I swear I've never loved you more (Loved you more)
When you right here, I come alive
One more hit and we can fly
This shit feel like (Paradise)
