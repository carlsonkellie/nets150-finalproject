[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad
[Verse 1]
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal
Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape

[Chorus]
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Bridge]
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around

[Chorus]
For now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

But now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Outro]
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 3: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Outro: Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
When you're looking at my photos
Getting hot, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Now, now, now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

[Chorus]
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
You're alone, going out of your mind
When I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm here looking fine, babe
And I got eyes looking my way
And everybody's on my vibe, babe
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
My friends said you were a bad man
I should have listened to them back then
And now you're tryna hit me up again
Now, now, now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger

Let's get drunk
I'll pour my heart out through my mouth
This year's been hard for us, no doubt
Let's raise a glass to a better one
Let all the things that we've overcome
Bring hope to us 'cause
Me and you, we can hold this out
Only you understand how I'm feeling now, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know I can tell you anything
You won't judge, you're just listening, yeah
'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me

[Chorus]
'Cause my darling, you and I
Could take over the world
One step at a time
Just you and I (Just you and I)
'Cause you're the only one
Who brings light just like the sun
One step at a time
Just you and I (Just you and I)

[Verse 2]
Let's get drunk
Reminisce about the days
We were broke, not getting paid
And taking trips on the weekend
When I would drive down to see ya
And we would paint the town
Too many shot, I'll be passing out
'Cause I can never keep up
Quad vods, now I'm puking up

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I can tell you anything
You won't judge, you're just listening, yeah
'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me

[Chorus]
'Cause my darling, you and I

One step at a time
Just you and I (Just you and I)
'Cause you're the only one
Who brings light just like the sun
One step at a time
Just you and I (Just you and I, just you and I)

[Verse 3]
Tired of chasing paper
Staring at this screen
Been saving up for weeks now
Just to get to you, my dear
And though you're far from my home
This ain't no weekend bar
Oh, my heart grows fonder
Must be city love

[Chorus]
'Cause my darling, you and I
Could take over the world
One step at a time
Just you and I
'Cause my darling, you and I
Could take over the world
One step at a time
Just you and I (Just you and I)
'Cause you're the only one
Who brings light just like the sun
One step at a time
Just you and I (Just you and I)

[Outro]
Yeah, one step at a time, just you and I
Yeah, one step at a time, just you and I

We change the weather, yeah
I'm feelin' heat in December when you're 'round me

And make I come check you, my baby
No time, no
And my dawg is on probation
Another 5 years
Me bring girls to his location
No time, no

[Verse 1: Dave]
Send me the location
This year ’bout vacations
Flight catching, train taking
Soon as my nigga off probation
Your boyfriend's on a waiting ting
Looking for one wish, on a Ray J ting
I pree'd that girl, outrageous ting
But she can’t see 'cause I got shades and ting
Bare girls wanna throw shade and ting
No shade, what shade is your foundation in?
Darkest grey, the shade I'm in
49 more if your babes wants in
I had me a famous ting
Goals and tings, gains and tings
My house party a babe station
Girls wanna chase, it's a status ting

[Chorus: Burna Boy]
If you send me the location

[Verse 2: Dave]
Look, playboy, I don't need a Carti
I'm captain, I lead the army
Bad ratio, I leave the party
Three Somalis creepin' on me
Your ex wavy, we tsunami
Girl from India, sweet as naani
Head so good, now I speak Gujarati
You hardly, pardon me, I’m laughing again
I assisted, man, passed to my friend
Look, money like the alphabet
If you wanna see P’s, gotta pass on the ends
Came a long way from a park in the bends
To an '18 plate, man’s parking a Benz
Far from the rest but I'm far from my best
Life is a lesson, I'm passing a test
Yes, everyting blessed
I don't want drama and I don’t want stress
My girl got finesse, Caribbean flex
Body and chest, take buddy in chest
Thank God more, I grew up with less
Juss to the right, Rapz to the left
Rj in the middle, got Cee to the death
Batch full of dogs with the 60's vets

[Chorus: Burna Boy]
If you send me the location
Then I'll be right there
And make I come check you, my baby
No time, no
And my dawg is on probation

And all the games you play never stop right now

[Verse 3: Burna Boy]
I pull up on the block, I see everybody watching
'Cause there's diamonds on my chain
And there's diamonds on my watch
Money moves, Off-White shoes
Came straight from Virgil Abloh
I've been down, I've been low
Had my mattress on the floor
No map, North Cap, bend it up
Gyal a ring-ring my cellular
Mi 'ave big fat spliff pon me, nuh
Inna the big black Benz, pullin' up
Please tell everybody to start pulling up
'Nough champagne from the bar coming up
Party hard, make her live my life, oh

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts

Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, started off right

Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it

So stop thinkin' 'bout it

Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Verse 2]
I think I see your face in every place that I go
I try to hide it, but I know that it's gonna show
Every single night, I find it harder to sleep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Outro]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
'Cause I need you here with me
[Verse 1]
Can you hear me? S.O.S.
Help me put my mind to rest
Two times clean again, I'm actin' low
A pound of weed and a bag of blow

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers

[Verse 2]
I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to bleed
I'd let go, but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how, but I need to now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Drop]
(We could be) We could be more than just part-time lovers
(Part-time lovers, yeah)
(More than, more than lovers)
We could be more than just part-time lovers

Paris Fashion Week, I'm watching Louis Vuitton
Saw her favourite rapper, listen, now she feeling my song
But everything she do is for the media
I might duck you for your bredrin, I don't need ya
Her exes always tryna follow, I'ma lead ya
Her body tight, she looking hot up like a fever
Got me looking eager

[Verse 1: MoStack]
I only trust girls on days that don't end with a Y
Don't ask why, you can't ever see trust
Catch up, you could never keep up
Wrist froze if I ever freeze up
You know say we flex and we sex who we like
You no see the money, man, it's like you turned blind eye
Ooh, five bags that's a bad night
Ooh, we getting money now she like life
Fucked her with the blindfold, she ugly like me
She no say nothin', she just thought I was a freak
You can get a crackin' when I see you on the streets
No lackin' nigga, you don't want beef
You know that they do this for real, mama
You know that they catch and they kill, mama
You know that I'm feeling your style, mama
You know we got it locked for the whole summer

[Chorus: AJ Tracey]
She smell like Yves Saint Laurent (Yves Saint Laurent)
My garms are from Italy, I feel like the don (I feel like the don)
Paris Fashion Week, I'm watching Louis Vuitton (Louis Vuitton)
Saw her favourite rapper, listen, now she feeling my song (She feeling)
But everything she do is for the media (For the media)
I might duck you for your bredrin, I don't need ya (I don't need ya)
Her exes always tryna follow, I'ma lead ya (Lead ya)
Her body tight, she looking hot up like a fever
Got me looking eager

[Verse 2: AJ Tracey]
Remy in my cup got me seeing every peng ting twice
Now I'm feeling nice, no mixer, just ice
She said I'm too cold, baby, that's the ice
Free my niggas that are scrubs doing deals for the rice
You're taking pics but will you back the beef?
I'm a VIP, for real, with these stacks on me
Tryna beef with who I love, that's a catastrophe
'Cause we all came up out the mud like it's Glastonbury
Fendi on my belt match my pretty brown miss
And my Henny's super rare, that's some expensive brown piss
She said she wants tequila but I ain't about this
I don't really drink Patron when I ain't around MIST
And I hate makeup, that's your choice though
Rest assured, you can't get up in this Royce though
I'm up on all of my opps as far as points go
'Cause no one's copping what we're copping with this coin flow

[Chorus: AJ Tracey]
She smell like Yves Saint Laurent (Yves Saint Laurent)
My garms are from Italy, I feel like the don (I feel like the don)
Paris Fashion Week, I'm watching Louis Vuitton (Louis Vuitton)
Saw her favourite rapper, listen, now she feeling my song (She feeling)
But everything she do is for the media (For the media)
I might duck you for your bredrin, I don't need ya (I don't need ya)
Her exes always tryna follow, I'ma lead ya (Lead ya)
Her body tight, she looking hot up like a fever
Got me looking eager

[Intrumental]

[Chorus: AJ Tracey]
She smell like Yves Saint Laurent (Yves Saint Laurent)
My garms are from Italy, I feel like the don (I feel like the don)
Paris Fashion Week, I'm watching Louis Vuitton (Louis Vuitton)
Saw her favourite rapper, listen, now she feeling my song (She feeling)
But everything she do is for the media (For the media)
I might duck you for your bredrin, I don't need ya (I don't need ya)
Her exes always tryna follow, I'ma lead ya (Lead ya)
Her body tight, she looking hot up like a fever
Got me looking eager

Billie

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa

[Verse 1: Lauv]
Party, trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me is falling in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it, taking a shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think that they make anything that strong, so I hold on
I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers
And when they leave, I go back to our song, I hold on
I, I, oh I
Hurts like heaven, lost in the sound
Buzz cut season like you're still around
Can't unmiss you and I need you now
Yeah, I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv & Troye Sivan]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
I'm so tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love songs (Someone take me home)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home ('Cause I can't be alone)
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs ('Cause I'm so tired)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa

See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin’ (I be grinnin’), yeah

[Chorus]
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me

Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (On me)
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me (Know me)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It’s a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)

[Verse 2]
Everywhere I go (Hey)
Catch me on the block like I'm Mutombo (Wow)
750 Lambo in the Utah snow (Skrrt)
Trunk in the front like that shit Dumbo, yeah
Cut the roof off like a nip-tuck
Pull up to the house with some big butts
Turn the kitchen counter to a strip-club (Yeah, wow)
Me and Dre came for the...
When I got guap, all of y'all just appeared (Wow)
Before I dropped Stoney, none of y'all really cared (Cared)
Now they always say, "Congratulations," to the kid (Kid)
And this is not a 40, but I'm pourin' out this shit (Yeah)
Used to have a lot, but I got more now (Yup)
Made another hit 'cause I got bored now (Yup)
Always goin' for it, never punt fourth down
Last call, Hail Mary, Prescott touchdown, ayy

[Chorus]
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (On me)
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army (Hey)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me (Yeah, yeah)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow"

[Outro]
Got 'em sayin', "Wow"
Ayy, ayy, wow
Sayin', "Wow"
Wow
Wow
[Verse 1]
You got me some type of way (Hmm)
Ain't used to feelin' this way (Mmm-mmm)

But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one fuckin' look at your face (Hmm)
Now I wanna know how you taste (Mmm-mmm)
Usually don't give it away (Yeah, yeah)
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]

When I know you out here thinkin' 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you realize she's right there (Yeah)
And you're at home like, "Damn, she can't compare"

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)

You could say I'm hatin' if you want to
But I only hate on her 'cause I want you
Say I'm trippin' if you feel like
But you without me ain't right (Ain't right)
You could call me crazy 'cause I want you
And I never even ever fuckin' met you
Say I'm trippin' and it ain't right
But you without me ain't nice (Ain't nice, yeah)

[Chorus]
Break up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the whispers all across the room?
You feel her eyes all over you like cheap perfume
You're beautiful, but misunderstood
So why you tryna be just like the neighborhood?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see ya, I know what you're feelin'
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret
I'm a little crazy underneath this
Underneath this

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Verse 2]
Oh so, dress up fancy like Sid and Nancy (Yeah)
Walkin' Killer Queen, gotta keep 'em guessin'
So baby come pass me a lighter
We're gonna leave 'em on fire
We're the sinners and the blessings

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see ya, I know what you're feelin'
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret
I'm a little crazy underneath this
Underneath this, ooh

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)

[Bridge]
(Ah-ah-ah)
You're king and you're queen
You're strong then you're weak
You're bound but so free
(Ah-ah-ah)
So come and join me
And call me Harley
And we'll make 'em scream

[Chorus]
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I)
Do you ever feel like an outcast?
You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)
[Intro: Mxjib]
I make money online
I make money on time
I make money online
All my niggas got me makin' money online
I make money on time
Shawty wanna fuck but I give her no time (JAE5)

[Chorus: OGD]
Want to make a mil', 9-5 weren't an option
In the field you kinda run outta options
She always complain like she nah see me often
But often I be OT tourin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'
Used to move like there's nothin' to lose
Mixed the Off-White with the Hues
Rollin' with like 10 of the goons

[Verse 1: Kruddz]
Money callin', money talkin'
Trap phone goin' ring ring
Trap phone buy me bling-bling, yeah
Where was you way back then?
I was doing stick up with my bad friends
Police had us twist up pon the landin'
Every other time mix up in violence

[Verse 2: PapiiAbz]
Not just because of the bustdown
But I'm on the grind 'till I'm up now
Hustle in the blood, I'm a hustler
Tough striker call me Costa
And my line ringin' from qway
Trap line ringin' all day
And my line ringin' from qway
Trap line singin' all day

[Chorus: OGD]
Want to make a mil', 9-5 weren't an option
In the field you kinda run outta options
She always complain like she nah see me often
But often I be OT tourin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'
Used to move like there's nothin' to lose
Mixed the Off-White with the Hues
Rollin' with like 10 of the goons

[Verse 3: Tion Wayne]
Ghetto and stylish
LV drop, man I rock it with sliders
Shopping abroad first day I'm off-license
Came fresh home first thing I done, diamonds
All about timin', wrist so blindin'
'Cause she's all boo'd up, man she got haters
We don't fly Europe, we just go Vegas
Man try draws her, she don't do strangers
Fuck about status, uh
'Bout Corsa, put her in a Porcshe
Eyebrow sharpish, lookin' like my borer
Come a long way from chillin' on a corner
Fat ass, bloody hell that's torture
I ain't getting poorer
Always complain that she can't see me often
I just keep it real, I can't run out of option
I can see you're stressed out and you keep callin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'

[Chorus: OGD]
Want to make a mil', 9-5 weren't an option
In the field you kinda run outta options
She always complain like she nah see me often
But often I be OT tourin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'
Used to move like there's nothin' to lose
Mixed the Off-White with the Hues
Rollin' with like 10 of the goons

[Verse 4: Mojo]
Amazing, all of this money I'm making
Nights on the back roads, didn't phase me
Did it for the culture where they raised me
About to make a move
Might have to sell food
Do what you gotta do
And tell the judge, "Free the goons"

[Verse 5: OGD]
Put that loud pack in my loud pack
And I'm totin' it quick plus all of the gang
Baby girl you look familiar
Convo start and mi wan' fi get familiar
Girl,​ I'm a trendy yute
Lemme put you in them new Fendi shoes
Guys only hate when they wanna be you
Guys only hate when they wanna be you
I can never be you, nah nah

[Chorus: OGD]
Want to make a mil', 9-5 weren't an option
In the field you're gonna run outta options
She always complain like she nah see me often
But often I be OT tourin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'
Used to move like there's nothin' to lose
Mixed the Off-White with the Hues
Rollin' with like 10 of the goons

[Outro: DopeBoy]
Makin' money
She said, "Nigga, you don't make no time for me"
Because mi trap-trap 'til the early mornin'
And now they pray on the downfall of me
You can't take my shine
This shine makin' niggas close blinds
There's no stoppin' this grind
Fuck around I'll take your pic to the shrine
[Chorus]
I'm taking your Mrs, nah brudda, I’m joking
All these bad B's stay preeing cah I stepped in looking all frozen
My girl with the back looks lovely, like she ain't ever looking like your ting
Bro-bro stay busy in the bando and he told me it’s getting all boring
I'm taking your Mrs, nah brudda, I'm joking
All these bad B's stay preeing cah I stepped in looking all frozen
My girl with the back looks lovely, like she ain't ever looking like your ting
Bro-bro stay busy in the bando and he told me it's getting all boring

[Verse 1]
Fuck sake, how many times did I make that exit?
The popo came quick so I legged it, stepped in the dance and the crowd went hectic
My bad B from Manny brought Beckeh
Spent one week in the 0161, now I call Cov' girls sexeh
Cheeky vodka with Coco
What's her name? I think Gogo
Fuck with her ’cause she loco
Mix the pondu na loso (Ha)
She post one pic on her Insta, hair on fleek and her skin like Kinder
And that boy there with the bootcut vexed ’cause his girl got swiped like Tinder
Back then girls tried air me, peak, but I switched cah I ball like Inter
Gang come through, you're a sprinter, winger, you’re a joke man, best fix up
And I don't really wanna do problems
Private party in C-O-V, got bad B's coming from London
And I just backed five-six shots of the JD drink, now my head can't function
And my nigga Nav just sold white to the black guy, now the black guys all sunken
Baby girl why you texting me, why you moving so desperately?
Shoot your shot like a penalty, let it sing like a melody

[Chorus]
I’m taking your Mrs, nah brudda, I'm joking
All these bad B's stay preeing cah I stepped in looking all frozen
My girl with the back looks lovely, like she ain't ever looking like your ting
Bro-bro stay busy in the bando and he told me it's getting all boring
I'm taking your Mrs, nah brudda, I'm joking
All these bad B's stay preeing cah I stepped in looking all frozen
My girl with the back looks lovely, like she ain't ever looking like your ting
Bro-bro stay busy in the bando and he told me it's getting all boring

[Verse 2]
Ten pound for the taxi, that's guwop
Get brain in the backseat, no toss
Buss nut, then I skirt out, no fuss
Gun lean with a bad B like Russ
Five girls in a three door, that's nuts
Don't ask silly questions man, touch
Make P but you're still taking bus
Talk shit but I couldn't give two fucks
Ayy, JAY1 too saucy, link up with a bad B from Aussie
Fuck up the beat like forty, JAY1 spit something, doing up talky
And half of them chicks all bore me, bop to the studio then I linked up Coolie
Stepped in the dance and my garms all sporty, peng girl with the big breast look naughty

[Chorus]
Nah brudda, I'm joking
All these bad B's stay preeing cah I stepped in looking all frozen
My girl with the back looks lovely, like she ain't ever looking like your ting
Bro-bro stay busy in the bando and he told me it's getting all boring

[Outro]
I'm taking your Mrs
[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got a juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)
[Verse 1]
I know I should be ordering takeout
Sitting on my couch, that's what you do
I know I should be all in my feelings
Staring at the ceiling, but here's the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Wallowing in it would be such a waste
That isn't gonna fix it anyway, no whoa

[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
I dry my eyes 'cause I don't feel like crying
Ooh, yeah
At least tonight, no, I don't feel like crying

[Verse 2]
Hope you don't blame me for what I'm saying
My heart is aching, do you feel it too?
I hope you understand that I'm dealing
It's my way of healing, but here's the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Wallowing in it would be such a waste
That isn't gonna fix it anyway, no whoa

[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
I dry my eyes 'cause I don't feel like crying
Ooh, yeah
At least tonight, no, I don't feel like crying

[Post-Chorus]
It hasn't hit me yet (Ooh)
And I know if I go home I'm gonna get upset, yeah
It hasn't hit me yet
And I know if I go home I'm gonna get upset
It hasn't hit me yet (Ooh)
And I know if I go home I'm gonna get upset
At least tonight, no, I don't feel like crying

[Pre-Chorus]
Wallowing in it would be such a waste
That isn't gonna fix it anyway, no, whoa

[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
I dry my eyes 'cause I don't feel like crying
Ooh, yeah
At least tonight, no, I don't feel like crying

[Post-Chorus]
It hasn't hit me yet (Ooh)
And I know if I go home I'm gonna get upset, yeah
It hasn't hit me yet
And I know if I go home I'm gonna get upset
It hasn't hit me yet (Ooh)
And I know if I go home I'm gonna get upset
At least tonight, no, I don't feel like crying
[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Hoo, huh, uh, huhh-ow
Huh, huhh-huhhh

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now
[Verse 1]
"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say (Aww)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha)

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Verse 2]
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
(Yay)

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Bridge]
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 1]
She'll make you curse, but she a blessing
She'll rip your shirt within a second
You'll be coming back, back for seconds
With your plate, you just can't help it

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying, "No, no"
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 2]
See, someone said, "Don't drink her potions
She'll kiss your neck with no emotion
When she's mean, you know you love it
She tastes so sweet, don't sugarcoat it"

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying, "No (No, no, no), no (No)"
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes," 'cause she messin' with your head

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Bridge]
You're just like me, you're out your mind
I know it's strange, we're both the crazy kind
You're tellin' me that I'm insane
Boy, don't pretend that you don't love the pain

[Chorus]
Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Post-Chorus]
Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho

Used to have the pack in my long johns, now I rap

[Verse 4: 6ix9ine]
If a nigga wanna act out, got the MAC out

Say my name in your song and it's lit, yeah
Been waiting for a nigga like this, yeah
We got London On Da Track
[Verse 1]
There's somethin' in the way you roll your eyes
Takes me back to a better time
When I saw everything is good
But now you're the only thing that's good
Tryna stand up on my own two feet
This conversation ain't coming easily
And darlin', I know it's getting late
So what do you say we leave this place?

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

[Verse 2]
There's somethin' in the way I wanna cry
That makes me think we'll make it out alive
So come on and show me how we're good
I think that we could do some good, mhm

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
'Cause I can't be alone with all that's on my mind
Say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong, there is so much wrong
There is so much wrong goin' on outside

[Chorus: J Hus]
Smiling like a nice person
Came on a Rambo ting, everyting camouflaging
Looking like a bulletproof vest, nah, that's just a body warmer
Big man gossiping, there's noting worser
I swear I'm a father for them man
Bring something larger for them man
Disaster, disaster for them man
Them man, them man, them man there
Make a one trip there, just to make a one ting clear
Then fly out to Edinburgh
I'm so fly, I might just pop my collar
Need a zoobie to roll
Left eye look through your soul
I'm blinded by love while I'm winking at you
I'm thinking out loud so you know I'm always thinking 'bout you
Same time, I don't think I'm too irrational

[Verse: Dave & J Hus]
Fuck beefing with babies
Catch a man raving
We're taking your paper, your 'yac and your ladies
Fistfight, this bitch bites like it's rabies
Drop from your baby, catch him there
I'm standing here
Bumped into Dave by the Santander
You was in the same spot you was in last year
You said, "Life ain't fair"
I know man who live life in fear
This time last year
You were on the same block, standing there
Smoking, gossiping, chatting bare
Don't tell me that you ain't involved
Them JME 'cause a man don't care
Man don't business, love no witness
Hug no traitor, spud no snitches
Man try live this, never knew he had a clitoris
Have man for breakfast, talk about hit list
I bring the fire, you liar and a backstabber
I'm with the born-chasers or I'm with the cash grabbers
I'm doing mathematics, automatic, never static
And she don't know my real name, she thought I was Patrick
Sit back and smoke a baseball bat
You think this is the life but it ain't all that
I've done some evil things that I wouldn't take back
I keep it to myself 'cause people wanna chat
Keep it to yourself, people wanna talk
Flossing in the gossip's how you end up in a war
I got nothing for a fed, copper for your head
And that's the definition of a penny for your thoughts
We just live and maintain
We on the same streets but we don't play the same game
You're the type to get caught and go and play the blame game
You should be ashamedIf I stick to my heart, I put my stick to your brain
Let it rip for the pain, they put shit on my name, 'til I grip and I aim
Dip on a plane with a brand new name
Mummy, I got a flight to catch
All for an internet gangster or a cyber-man
Mike Myers man, a couple tries tried to try a man
My boys put stars in the hood like I'm Stryder, man
I know people wearing Rollies doing life in can
Isn't that ironic that they couldn't find the time to plan?
Still keep a faith in God, still couldn't spare the rod
Marcel, you know me, I came with the blazing squad
You better pray to God whenever I'm in town
Like a kid in a divorce, I'm leaving with your spouse
I can't make a horse or the river open its mouth
You ain't got the drive, that's why you're in a drought
Life's great, I'm in Sweden or Copenhagen
Getting brain from a Dane whose first name I can't pronounce

[Chorus: J Hus]
Smiling like a nice person
Came on a Rambo ting, everyting camouflaging
Looking like a bulletproof vest, nah, that's just a body warmer
Big man gossiping, there's noting worser
I swear I'm a father for them man
Bring something larger for them man
Disaster, disaster for them man
Them man, them man, them man there
Make a one trip there, just to make a one ting clear
Then fly out to Edinburgh
I'm so fly, I might just pop my collar
Need a zoobie to roll
Left eye look through your soul
I'm blinded by love while I'm winking at you
I'm thinking out loud so you know I'm always thinking 'bout you
Same time, I don't think I'm too irrational
[Intro: Sam Smith]
Hmm, mhm

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
I don't wanna be alone tonight (Alone tonight)
It's pretty clear that I'm not over you (Over you, over you)
I'm still thinking 'bout the things you do (Things you do)
So I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight
Can you light the fire? (Light the fire, light the fire)
I need somebody who can take control (Take control)
I know exactly what I need to do
'Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
Dancing with a stranger

[Verse 2: Normani]
I wasn't even going out tonight (Out tonight)
But, boy, I need to get you off of my mind (Off of my mind)
I know exactly what I have to do
I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight

[Chorus: Normani, Sam Smith & Both]
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
Dancing with a stranger
Dancing with a stranger
Dancing, yeah, ooh

[Outro: Sam Smith, Normani & Both]
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new (Ooh)
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
I'm dancing, I'm dancing (Ooh)
I'm dancing, I'm dancing (Dancing with a stranger)

Get to roll no...
Ayy, I'm in the studio, bro
Oh, nah, yeah, call me, ball me
Yeah, I'll... bet
Yeah, I'm at the studio, hold up though

[Verse 1]
I ain't get to roll no weed, I ain't get to roll no Swishers
I was locked up on Christmas, ain't get to see my niggas
Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time

[Chorus]
I wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind (I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind

[Verse 2]
Yellow tape around his body, it's a fucking homicide
His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him it's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind
(I got murder on my mind)

[Verse 3]
Bite like tarantula, bitch, I'm an animal
Melly's a savage, no he not no amateur
Bad bitch named Angela, fucked her on camera
Bitch I'm a murderer (Yeah, yeah)
I might just kill the boy, don't wanna kill the boy
Bake him up, say he want beef, we gon' grill the boy
(Grill the boy, we gonna grill the boy)
I'm bleeding so good, I might dip his ass in it and spill the boy
Haha, murder on my mind, whoa, whoa
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind, huh

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind
(Murder on my mind)

[Outro]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Young Nigga World, bitch
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Verse 2]
Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Bridge]
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

[Chorus]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Intro]
High, high hopes

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes

[Verse 1]
Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

[Verse 2]
Mama said, it's uphill for oddities
The stranger crusaders, ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything (High, high hopes)

[Bridge]
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me-eh-eh-eh
So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh

[Bridge]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)

[Chorus]
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
[Verse 1]
Home grown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar
I could get used to this

[Pre-Chorus]
Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be

[Chorus]
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone

[Verse 2]
South of the Equator, navigator
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
And deep sea divin' 'round the clock, bikini bottoms, lager tops
I could get used to this

[Pre-Chorus]
Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be

[Chorus]
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone

[Bridge]
We got two in the front
Two in the back
Sailin' along
And we don't look back
(Back, back, back-back-back-back...)

[Pre-Chorus]
Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be

[Chorus]
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone, a someone, a someone, a someone...
[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Bridge]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Outro]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

[Intro: Drake & Future]
Yeah
(Wheezy outta here)
Jeez, jeez

[Verse 1: Drake]
Back home, smokin' legal (Legal)
I got more slaps than The Beatles (Beatles)
Foreign shit runnin' on diesel, dawg
Playin' with my name, that shit is lethal, dawg (Who you say you was?)
Don Corleone
Trust me, at the top it isn't lonely (Strapped)
Everybody actin' like they know me, dawg
Don't just say you're down, you gotta show me (What you gotta do?)
Bring the clip back empty (It's empty)
You asked to see the boss, so they sent me, dawg (Sent me, dawg)
I just broke her off with a 10-piece, dawg (10-piece, dawg)
That ain't nothin', I'm just bein' friendly, dawg

[Chorus: Drake]
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day

[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, lot of Murakami in the hallway (What?)
Got a sticky and I keep it at my dawg's place
Girl, I left your love at Magic, now it's all shade
Still goin' bad on you anyway

[Interlude: Meek Mill]
Woah, woah, ooh, woah
Woah, woah, ah

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I could fit like 80 racks in my Amiris (80 racks)
Me and Drizzy back-to-back, it's gettin' scary (Back-to-back)
If you fuckin' with my opps, just don't come near me (Get outta my way)
Put some bands all on your head like Jason Terry (Brrt, brrt, ooh)
Richard Mille cost a Lambo (That's a Lambo)
Known to keep the baddest bitches on commando (Salute)
Every time I'm in my trap, I move like Rambo (Extended)
Ain't a neighborhood in Philly that I can't go (That's a Fendi)
For real
She said, "Oh, you rich rich?" ("You rich rich")
Bitch, I graduated, call me "Big Fish" (Marlin)
I got Lori Harvey on my wish list (That's Lori)
That's the only thing I want for Christmas (True story, uh)
I've been had my way out here, yeah, know that's facts (Facts)
You ain't livin' that shit you say, yeah, we know that's cap (That's cap)
You ain't got to ask me when you see me, know I'm strapped (Brrt)
DC, OVO, we back again, we goin' plat' (Ooh, ooh)

[Chorus: Drake]
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day

[Outro: Future]
Wheezy outta here
[Intro]
No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There’s a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn

[Verse 1]
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin’ to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Interlude]
I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life

[Verse 2]
Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever ’cause I don’t self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it (Teh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you’re the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Bridge]
Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my— asking about my motto

[Interlude]
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right?

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Outro]
Did you like it? Did you like that?
Um, which part?
[Verse 1]
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin'—

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Said thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fucking—

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Said thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Yeah, yee

[Intro]
I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes

[Verse 1]
I can't seem to drown you out long enough
I fell victim to the sound of your love
You're like a song that I ain't ready to stop
I got nothing but you on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes
Don't wanna let the pieces fall out of place
I was only just a breath removed from going to waste
Till I found salvation in the form of your...

[Chorus]
Your grace
Your grace
Your grace
Don't take it away
Your grace
Your grace
Your grace
Don't take it away

[Verse 2]
On the verge of almost bleeding you out
Are we too wounded now to ever come down?
Oh, how I long for us to find common ground
I got nothing but you on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes
Don't wanna let the pieces fall out of place
I was only just a breath removed from going to waste
Till I found salvation in the form of your...

[Chorus]
Your grace
Your grace
Your grace
Don't take it away
Your grace
Your grace
Your grace
Don't take it, take it—

[Bridge]
Way too close to colour your comfort
All dressed up but kept undercover
Way too close to colour your comfort
All dressed up but kept undercover

[Chorus]
Your grace
Your grace
Your grace
Don't take it away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not ready to be just another of your mistakes
Don't wanna let the pieces fall out of place
I was only just a breath removed from going to waste
Till I found salvation in the form of your...

[Chorus]
Your grace (Your grace)
Your grace (Your grace)
Your grace (Your grace)
Don't take it away
Your grace (Your grace)
Your grace (Your grace)
Your grace
Don't take it away
[Verse 1]
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Verse 2]
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)

[Bridge]
You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown (You should see me, see me)
Your silence is my favorite sound (You should see me, see me)
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one
[Verse 1]
Can't count up the times you've blown my line
And that's been on my mind a lot lately
I wanna leave the extra all behind, mmm
And I know that you wanna be my baby, mmm yeah

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Verse 2]
Oh, we both care about it
But arguing with me just isn't worth it
No, no, no
Don't go reachin' in your bag, your bag, yeah
I didn't text you back 'cause I was workin'
Ah, yeah

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Bridge]
Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love
You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love
Gave you all the signs
Gave you all of my time, my love
(Gave you all my time and all my love)
You're followin' the signs
But you're followin' the wrong signs, my love

[Chorus]
Said, my bad
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin'
We was cool, yeah, we was vibin' (Vibin')
Gotta put my phone on silent (On silent)
So my, my, my, my bad (My bad)
Blowin' me up, you've been wildin' (Blowin' me up)
We were cool, yeah, we was vibin'
Gotta put my phone on silent
So my, my, my bad

[Outro]
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my
My bad, my bad
Alright
