NETS150 HW5
Kellie Carlson and Jasmine Wang

We want to analyze the similarities/differences in lyrical contents for the top English songs in each country around the world. We will see which countries are most similar in their top songs, and examine if and how these countries are related. Modeling countries as nodes of a graph, we will then place edges based on geography, trade, and airline flight frequency.

Categories used: 
-Graph and graph algorithms: represent each country as node and perform graph algorithms such as shortest path to correlate countries
-Document search: each country's song lyrics form a document and used tf-idf/cosine similarity metric to compare song lyrics between countries

Work breakdown:
Jasmine: Obtained CSVs of top songs in 20 countries
Kellie: Extracted lyrics for top songs for each country in Python, generated country documents
Jasmine: Obtained trade CSVs and parsed them in Java
Kellie: Obtained airline text files and parsed them in Python
Kellie: Obtained geography JSON file and parsed it in Python
Jasmine: Calculated IR similarity b/w countries
Jasmine: Data cleaning for trade data
Kellie: Data cleaning for flight and geography data
Kellie: Created NetworkX graphs based on song similarity, geography, trade & flights
Kellie: Ran shortest path algorithms on geography graph
Jasmine: Graph visualization
Both: Graph algorithms analysis (compare & contrast between song graph and others)
